This technology is important because it offers you an attractive alternative to vertical growth by adding new z/VM systems. In the past, this capability required duplicate efforts to install, maintain, and manage each system. With SSI, these duplicate efforts are reduced or eliminated. Support for live guest relocation (LGR) allows you to move Linux virtual servers without disrupting your business or incurring loss of service, thus reducing planned outages. The z/VM systems are aware of each other and take advantage of their combined resources. LGR enables you to relocate guests from a system requiring maintenance to a system that will remain active during maintenance. A major advantage for DB2 v10 customers is that using z/VM 6.2 does not require any changes to existing DB2 structures. This remarkable benefit is due to the fact that DB2 v10 is installed as part of the LInux guest on z/VM and is fully integrated into LGR. This allows you to smoothly move DB2 v10 when you move Linux virtual servers, without interrupting either DB2 v10 or z/VM operations and services. This IBM Redbooks® publication will help you understand how DB2 10 on Linux for System z® behaves while running on a z/VM that is being relocated using z/VM's 6.2 Live Guest Relocation feature. In this book, we explore memory management, the DB2 Self-tuning memory manager feature, time synchronization, networking, and storage and performance considerations with regards to relocation. We also offer some best practices found during a live guest relocation for DB2 v10.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-_PHAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780738437422""","""en"

His encounter with the mysterious Brotherhood of Watchers drives him to the crusades, into a clash with the Doge in Venice and on to the disaster of Constantinople. But there is more to Walter than he dares imagine? What are the dark forces controlling him and those he loves? The story is wrenched into the present where a sinister Oxford don dies in mysterious circumstances leaving an occult manuscript based on Walter to his assistant Ian with certain instructions. As Ian seeks to unravel these and his own life and love begin to weave into Walter’s – to whom he bears a striking resemblance – the novel’s secrets deepen. This is a powerful and compelling tale about personal and political catastrophe and the individual’s resilience in a time of uncertainty and danger. It is also a daring and brilliant contemplation of the Middle Ages and its continuing importance. Walter’s work, it appears, is not finished, nor what he learnt, nor is his music lost forever.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-BPGCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781861515391""","""en"

Here is the unforgettable story of Jomny, an alien sent to study Earth. Always feeling apart, even among his species, Jomny feels at home for the first time among the earthlings he meets. There is a bear tired of other creatures running in fear, an egg struggling to decide what to hatch into, a turtle hiding itself by learning camouflage, a puppy struggling to express its true feelings, and many more. Jomny’s curious presence allows these characters to open up to him in new ways, revealing the power of somebody who is just there to listen. Everyone’s a Aliebn When Ur a Aliebn Too is also the story behind the widely-shared and typo-filled @jonnysun twitter account. Since the beginning, Sun intentionally tweeted from an outsider’s perspective, creating a truly distinct voice. Now, that outsider has taken shape in the character of Jomny, who observes Earth with the same intelligent, empathetic, and charmingly naïve voice that won over his fans on social media. Through this story of lonely Alien finding friendship, acceptance, and love among the animals and plants of Earth, we will all learn how to be a little more human.

"0QfTwQEACAAJ""","""The Power of q""","{"Michael D. Hirschhorn"}","""This unique book explores the world of q, known technically as basic hypergeometric series, and represents the author’s personal and life-long study—inspired by Ramanujan—of aspects of this broad topic. While the level of mathematical sophistication is graduated, the book is designed to appeal to advanced undergraduates as well as researchers in the field. The principal aims are to demonstrate the power of the methods and the beauty of the results. The book contains novel proofs of many results in the theory of partitions and the theory of representations, as well as associated identities. Though not specifically designed as a textbook, parts of it may be presented in course work; it has many suitable exercises. After an introductory chapter, the power of q-series is demonstrated with proofs of Lagrange’s four-squares theorem and Gauss’s two-squares theorem. Attention then turns to partitions and Ramanujan’s partition congruences. Several proofs of these are given throughout the book. Many chapters are devoted to related and other associated topics. One highlight is a simple proof of an identity of Jacobi with application to string theory. On the way, we come across the Rogers–Ramanujan identities and the Rogers–Ramanujan continued fraction, the famous “forty identities” of Ramanujan, and the representation results of Jacobi, Dirichlet and Lorenz, not to mention many other interesting and beautiful results. We also meet a challenge of D.H. Lehmer to give a formula for the number of partitions of a number into four squares, prove a “mysterious” partition theorem of H. Farkas and prove a conjecture of R.Wm. Gosper “which even Erdős couldn’t do.” The book concludes with a look at Ramanujan’s remarkable tau function.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0QfTwQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api""","""3319862413""","""en"

For well over five decades his work has been at the forefront of theoretical and philosophical thinking and writing. From his earliest work with Georges Poulet and the so-called Geneva School, which introduced a generation of North American critics to the concept of a phenomenological literary hermeneutic, to a deconstructive rhetorical philology and an ethically motivated textual analysis, Miller's readings have not only reflected major movements in literary theory, they have also created them.Surprisingly, Eamonn Dunne's J. Hillis Miller and the Possibilities of Reading is the first book devoted exclusively to examining Miller's work. Dunne argues that an appreciation of Miller is crucial to an informed understanding about the radical changes occurring in critical thinking in the humanities in recent years. This book, the first of its kind, will be a vital and enabling avenue for further research into J. Hillis Miller's exemplary and prolific output.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=28CoAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781441107145""","""en"

ICD-O is a dual classification with coding systems for both topography and morphology. The book has five main sections. The first provides general instructions for using the coding systems and gives rules for their implementation in tumour registries and pathology laboratories. Section two includes the numerical list of topography codes, which remain unchanged from the previous edition. The numerical list of morphology codes is presented in the next section, which introduces several new terms and includes considerable revisions of the non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukaemia sections, based on the WHO Classification of Hematopoietic and Lympoid Diseases. The five-digit morphology codes allow identification of a tumour or cell type by histology, behaviour, and grade. Revisions in the morphology section were made in consultation with a large number of experts and were finalised after field-testing in cancer registries around the world. The alphabetical index gives codes for both topography and morphology and includes selected tumour-like lesions and conditions.

With each chapter containing new content, readers are provided with new material on reduction, orbifolds, and the regularization of the Kepler problem, all of which are provided with applications. The previous editions grew out of graduate level courses in mathematics, engineering, and physics given at several different universities.

This text provides a mathematical structure of celestial mechanics ideal for beginners, and will be useful to graduate students and researchers alike. Reviews of the second edition: ""The primary subject here is the basic theory of Hamiltonian differential equations studied from the perspective of differential dynamical systems.

Vitamin D may play a role not only in the control of bone and mineral metabolism, but also appears to be involved in immune function, cardiovascular health, thrombosis and vasculogenesis and neuromuscular function. Considerable epidemiologic data demonstrate that low vitamin D serum levels occur very commonly in normal adult populations and that vitamin D deficiency is associated with an enhanced risk of cancer death from lung, prostate, head & neck, colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers. In addition, preclinical data provide evidence that calcitriol and other active analogues of calcitriol have anti-proliferative, pro-differentiative, pro-apoptotic and anti-angiogenic activity in numerous in-vitro and in-vivo models.

"4AU_BAAAQBAJ""","""U Can’T Make This Stuff Up""","{"Larry Malcolm"}","""The reason I wrote this book was to make available stories that prove it is not too late. I had discernment that I should write short stories and mix various topics with both humor and eternal consequences. On October 30, 2012, I was on an elevator flirting with several women. I walked off that elevator with an idea: a book about flirting. During the first week of November 2012, I asked Jesus to give me ideas for a book. In 48 hours, the Holy Spirit gave me 130 ideas for a book. Sixty weeks and 950 hours of work later, I have a complete manuscript. The Bible says Im just a filthy rag. Im not a preacher because Im not called and would be unworthy. Im not a teacher because I would have no patience, and Im not a speaker because Im very shy with large groups. Therefore, the printed virgin*. Maybe Im an explainer. I prefer to explain my faults and sins rather than point at others. There is a fine line between being judgmental and attempting to explain the truth. I once was told from an old-fashioned fire and brimstone preacher that he did not judge people, but people judged themselves with their actions. If U are truly told by the Son of God to give someone a message, U better do it. U are not going to like your life for being disobedient. However, U may temporarily not like your life for being obedient. It is a strange dichotomy in the dilemma of life. We have to not wither but have planted seeds in the good ground of life to withstand the persecution. I truly hope those who may feel offended by my humor or Bibles truths . . . will understand that Im speaking from my heart and only want to help, and Im incapable of expressing the right words at the right time in person. Please remember Im in this struggle too. Just because I have written a book . . . does not mean I am exempted from hell. A walk with Jesus and temptation from the devil is a daily battle. I need your prayers. Im a long ways from where I want to be in Christ.

"4bnOEAAAQBAJ""","""Ernest J. Gaines""","{"Karen Carmean"}","""Drawing on his rich Louisiana past, Ernest J. Gaines creates a fictional world representative of the human experience. His work explores the complex racial relationships—so much a part of Southern history and culture—and the unwritten and unspoken conventions of caste and class. Often structured around journeys of discovery, Gaines' works affirm the integrity of the individual and the unequivocal place in American life for Americans of African descent. This study offers a clear, accessible reading of Gaines' fiction. It analyzes in turn all of Gaines' novels as well as his collection of short stories. A complete bibliography of Gaines' fiction, as well as selected reviews and criticism, completes the study. Following a biographical chapter on Gaines' life, an overview of his fiction explores his work in light of his literary heritage and use of genre. Each of the following chapters examines an individual novel: Catherine Carmier (1964), Of Love and Dust (1967), The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman (1971), In My Father's House (1978), A Gathering of Old Men (1983), A Lesson Before Dying (1994), and a collection of short stories, Bloodline (1968). The discussion of each work includes sections on plot and character development, thematic issues, and an alternative critical approach from which to read the novel. Carmean shows how each of Gaines' novels focuses on themes of personal value and place and affirms the need for recognizing the value of the individual, regardless of race. This study will help readers to understand the compelling issue of human relationships raised by Gaines and to see why he is one of America's finest writers.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4bnOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780313317255""","""en"

"4Mfe4sAMFUYC""","""C in a Nutshell""","{"Peter Prinz"","""""Tony Crawford""}""","""Learning a language--any language--involves a process wherein you learn to rely less and less on instruction and more increasingly on the aspects of the language you've mastered. Whether you're learning French, Java, or C, at some point you'll set aside the tutorial and attempt to converse on your own. It's not necessary to know every subtle facet of French in order to speak it well, especially if there's a good dictionary available. Likewise, C programmers don't need to memorize every detail of C in order to write good programs. What they need instead is a reliable, comprehensive reference that they can keep nearby. C in a Nutshell is that reference. This long-awaited book is a complete reference to the C programming language and C runtime library. Its purpose is to serve as a convenient, reliable companion in your day-to-day work as a C programmer. C in a Nutshell covers virtually everything you need to program in C, describing all the elements of the language and illustrating their use with numerous examples. The book is divided into three distinct parts. The first part is a fast-paced description, reminiscent of the classic Kernighan & Ritchie text on which many C programmers cut their teeth. It focuses specifically on the C language and preprocessor directives, including extensions introduced to the ANSI standard in 1999. These topics and others are covered: Numeric constants Implicit and explicit type conversions Expressions and operators Functions Fixed-length and variable-length arrays Pointers Dynamic memory management Input and output The second part of the book is a comprehensive reference to the C runtime library; it includes an overview of the contents of the standard headers and a description of each standard library function. Part III provides the necessary knowledge of the C programmer's basic tools: the compiler, the make utility, and the debugger. The tools described here are those in the GNU software collection. C in a Nutshell is the perfect companion to K&R, and destined to be the most reached-for reference on your desk.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4Mfe4sAMFUYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780596550714""","""en"

Many illustrated examples and code chunks guide the reader into their modeling and interpretation. And, though the book primarily serves as a reference guide for the R package “compositions,” it is also a general introductory text on Compositional Data Analysis. Awareness of their special characteristics spread in the Geosciences in the early sixties, but a strategy for properly dealing with them was not available until the works of Aitchison in the eighties. Since then, research has expanded our understanding of their theoretical principles and the potentials and limitations of their interpretation. This is the first comprehensive textbook addressing these issues, as well as their practical implications with regard to software. The book is intended for scientists interested in statistically analyzing their compositional data. The subject enjoys relatively broad awareness in the geosciences and environmental sciences, but the spectrum of recent applications also covers areas like medicine, official statistics, and economics. Readers should be familiar with basic univariate and multivariate statistics. Knowledge of R is recommended but not required, as the book is self-contained.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4VhEAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9783642368097""","""en"
"4yE6EQAAQBAJ""","""P-38 Lightning in Detail & Scale, Part 1""","{"Bert Kinzey"}","""The Germans called it Der Gabelschwanz Teuful or “The Forked-tailed Devil.” The Japanese referred to it as two planes with one pilot. But whatever it was likened to, the Lockheed P-38 Lightning represented a giant step forward in combat aircraft design and technology. With its twin-engine, twin-boom design, and a fuselage pod between the booms, the P-38 Lightning was a radically different design from any previous fighter aircraft. Its high speed and long range, coupled with its firepower being concentrated in the fuselage pod, made it one of the most formidable fighters of World War II. Ideally suited for operations in the Pacific, it scored more aerial victories in that theater than any other USAAF fighter. In 1998, Detail & Scale published two books on the P-38 Lightning. These publications were very popular but have been out-of-print for quite some time. This publication, P-38 Lightning in Detail and Scale, Part 1is the first of two newly expanded, updated, and revised editions of Detail & Scale’s previous two-part coverage of the Lightning. A considereable number of color photographs, both historical and detail in nature, have been added. The focus of this volume is on the so-called early Lightnings, beginning with the first XP-38 prototype and continuing through the P-38H. Also included are the related F-4, F-4A, and F-5A photographic reconnaissance variants. When it first flew in 1939, the Lightning was larger, faster, and more heavily armed than any fighter aircraft in the world. Early variants of the P-38 found themselves thrust into combat as the United States entered World War II. In Europe, early Lightnings were plagued with problems associated with British fuels interacting with their exhaust-driven, turbo-supercharged engines at high altitudes. Elsewhere, in northern Africa, the Mediterranean, the Aleutians, and throughout the Pacific, the P-38 performed far more effectively and produced outstanding results in combat. America’s top two aces of World War II, Richard Bong and Thomas McGuire, scored all of their victories in the large P-38 while flying against smaller, more nimble Japanese aircraft known for their maneuverability. More than one hundred other aces scored all or most of their victories in the Lightining. This publication features expanded and revised historical overviews of the P-38s, along with detailed descriptions of each P-38 variant. The Early Lightning Details chapter also features new and expanded content compared to the original 1998 book. The chapter is illustrated with scores of detailed and meticulously restored photographs accompanied by captions that illustrate both important features and subtle differences between P-38 variants. Some of these images are original archival material, while others were chosen from hundreds of photos taken specifically for this book by the authors and their contributors. Of note, the Lightning Details chapter in P-38 Lightning in Detail and Scale, Part 1 features photos of the P-38F “Glacier Girl” to be found nowhere else. This P-38 was recovered from under the Greenland ice pack in 1992. Bert Kinzey took these photos during the restoration of “Glacier Girl” in 1998 and the photographs illustrate the details of the Lightning that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to represent. As with all of our publications in the Detail & Scale Series, the book concludes with a Modelers Section that features reviews of the plastic model kits of these early P-38 variants. Each review impartially and objectively highlights each kit’s strengths and weaknesses, along with ways that a scale modeler can correct or improve upon accuracy and details. P-38 Lightning in Detail & Scale, Part 1 contains over 200 high-resolution photographs along with dozens of detailed line drawings of the P-38 variants covered. The Early Lightning Details Chapter alone has 122 photographs.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4yE6EQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9798988667636""","""en"

"62K-DwAAQBAJ""","""Introduction to Data Science""","{"Rafael A. Irizarry"}","""Introduction to Data Science: Data Analysis and Prediction Algorithms with R introduces concepts and skills that can help you tackle real-world data analysis challenges. It covers concepts from probability, statistical inference, linear regression, and machine learning. It also helps you develop skills such as R programming, data wrangling, data visualization, predictive algorithm building, file organization with UNIX/Linux shell, version control with Git and GitHub, and reproducible document preparation. This book is a textbook for a first course in data science. No previous knowledge of R is necessary, although some experience with programming may be helpful. The book is divided into six parts: R, data visualization, statistics with R, data wrangling, machine learning, and productivity tools. Each part has several chapters meant to be presented as one lecture. The author uses motivating case studies that realistically mimic a data scientist’s experience. He starts by asking specific questions and answers these through data analysis so concepts are learned as a means to answering the questions. Examples of the case studies included are: US murder rates by state, self-reported student heights, trends in world health and economics, the impact of vaccines on infectious disease rates, the financial crisis of 2007-2008, election forecasting, building a baseball team, image processing of hand-written digits, and movie recommendation systems.

Much like reality, the stories told through poetry can only be understood as fragments- put together piece by piece like a puzzle. “If You Came For Tea And I Didn’t Have A Kettle” is a story of this kind. More specifically, it is a collection of around 50 poems, written over the course of a few years. These are poems written through the last of youth as it fades into the bitter potential of adulthood. These are poems written through the all-encompassing hope, grandeur and delusion at the start of first love, to the end of second love and the calm disappointment it brings. These are poems about one life. These are pieces of a life; and these pieces can be put together however you wish to line them up. Maybe you can even find a glimpse of your own life within their cracked surface.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=66l_EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""","""en"

The approach is also helpful for other personality disorders and conditions that are difficult to treat, e.g. addiction and eating disorders. MBT consists of a psychoeducational, an individual, and a group therapy component. This is the first comprehensive manual for mentalization-based group therapy. The author has developed the manual in close cooperation with Anthony Bateman and a team of group analysts. It covers all the aspects of MBT which are necessary to produce an informed and qualified group therapist. The book covers the theory behind mentalization and borderline personality disorder (especially its evolutionary roots), the structure of MBT and a discussion of previous experiences with group psychotherapy for borderline patients. The core of the book explains the main principles of MBT-G and provides a powerful means for ensuring that therapists adhere to these principles in a qualified way. The last part contains a full transcript from a real MBT group composed of borderline patients. As the first book dedicated to Group MBT, this book is a valuable and unique addition to the Mentalization literature.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6e6uCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780191068232""","""en"

The ""Stanzas of the Graves"" or ""Graves of the Warriors of the Island of Britain"", attributed to the legendary poet Taliesin, describe ancient heroes' burial places. Like the ""Triads of the Island of Britain"", they are an indispensable key to the narrative literature of medieval Wales. The heroes come from the whole of Britain, including Mercia and present-day Scotland, as well as many from Wales and a few from Ireland. Many characters known from the Mabinogion appear, often with additional information, as do some from romance and early Welsh saga, such as Arthur, Bedwyr, Gawain, Owain son of Urien, Merlin, and Vortigern. The seventh-century grave of Penda of Mercia, beneath the river Winwæd in Yorkshire, is the latest grave to be included. The poems testify to the interest aroused by megaliths, tumuli, and other apparently man-made monuments, some of which can be identified with known prehistoric remains. This volume offers a full edition and translation of the poems, mapped with reference to all the manuscripts, starting with the Black Book of Carmarthen, the oldest extant book of Welsh poetry.

Avoiding the traditional relegation of this subject to an emotional or private sphere, it traces Camus’s intellectual development in order to demonstrate the centrality of this subject to Camus’s work as a whole. If the Absurd, constructed over the body of the “real” woman, liberates the writer to follow a “true path” of literary creation, the impending loss of his Algerian homeland impells a return to “all that he had not been free to choose”, the ties of blood. These conflictual and unresolved ties are here investigated, in conjunction with the presentation of mythical female figures expressing Camus’s darkest fears, partly voiced in other writings, concerning that “other” Algeria for which he would never fight. Exploring complex interconnections between sexuality, “race” and colonialism, this volume is pertinent to all who are interested in the writings of Camus, particularly those seeking relevant new ways of approaching his work.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6P15DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9789401205696""","""en"

"7W38DwAAQBAJ""","""Random Forests with R""","{"Robin Genuer"","""""Jean-Michel Poggi""}""","""This book offers an application-oriented guide to random forests: a statistical learning method extensively used in many fields of application, thanks to its excellent predictive performance, but also to its flexibility, which places few restrictions on the nature of the data used. Indeed, random forests can be adapted to both supervised classification problems and regression problems. In addition, they allow us to consider qualitative and quantitative explanatory variables together, without pre-processing. Moreover, they can be used to process standard data for which the number of observations is higher than the number of variables, while also performing very well in the high dimensional case, where the number of variables is quite large in comparison to the number of observations. Consequently, they are now among the preferred methods in the toolbox of statisticians and data scientists. The book is primarily intended for students in academic fields such as statistical education, but also for practitioners in statistics and machine learning. A scientific undergraduate degree is quite sufficient to take full advantage of the concepts, methods, and tools discussed. In terms of computer science skills, little background knowledge is required, though an introduction to the R language is recommended. Random forests are part of the family of tree-based methods; accordingly, after an introductory chapter, Chapter 2 presents CART trees. The next three chapters are devoted to random forests. They focus on their presentation (Chapter 3), on the variable importance tool (Chapter 4), and on the variable selection problem (Chapter 5), respectively. After discussing the concepts and methods, we illustrate their implementation on a running example. Then, various complements are provided before examining additional examples. Throughout the book, each result is given together with the code (in R) that can be used to reproduce it. Thus, the book offers readers essential information and concepts, together with examples and the software tools needed to analyse data using random forests.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7W38DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9783030564858""","""en"

Apart from the obvious effects of vitamin D deficiency on skeletal metabolism, the problem is assuming even greater significance because observational and interventional studies have linked vitamin D deficiency to cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. This book addresses a variety of important issues that have emerged from this fast-moving area of clinical medicine.

It is based on R, a statistical programming language that has powerful data processing, visualization, and geospatial capabilities. The book equips you with the knowledge and skills to tackle a wide range of issues manifested in geographic data, including those with scientific, societal, and environmental implications. This book will interest people from many backgrounds, especially Geographic Information Systems (GIS) users interested in applying their domain-specific knowledge in a powerful open source language for data science, and R users interested in extending their skills to handle spatial data. The book is divided into three parts: (I) Foundations, aimed at getting you up-to-speed with geographic data in R, (II) extensions, which covers advanced techniques, and (III) applications to real-world problems. The chapters cover progressively more advanced topics, with early chapters providing strong foundations on which the later chapters build. Part I describes the nature of spatial datasets in R and methods for manipulating them. It also covers geographic data import/export and transforming coordinate reference systems. Part II represents methods that build on these foundations. It covers advanced map making (including web mapping), ""bridges"" to GIS, sharing reproducible code, and how to do cross-validation in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Part III applies the knowledge gained to tackle real-world problems, including representing and modeling transport systems, finding optimal locations for stores or services, and ecological modeling. Exercises at the end of each chapter give you the skills needed to tackle a range of geospatial problems. Solutions for each chapter and supplementary materials providing extended examples are available at https://geocompr.github.io/geocompkg/articles/.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8W2PDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781351396905""","""en"

Fans of Jacqueline Woodson, Meg Medina, and Jason Reynolds will fall hard for this astonishing New York Times-bestselling novel-in-verse by an award-winning slam poet, about an Afro-Latina heroine who tells her story with blazing words and powerful truth. Xiomara Batista feels unheard and unable to hide in her Harlem neighborhood. Ever since her body grew into curves, she has learned to let her fists and her fierceness do the talking. But Xiomara has plenty she wants to say, and she pours all her frustration and passion onto the pages of a leather notebook, reciting the words to herself like prayers—especially after she catches feelings for a boy in her bio class named Aman, who her family can never know about. With Mami’s determination to force her daughter to obey the laws of the church, Xiomara understands that her thoughts are best kept to herself. So when she is invited to join her school’s slam poetry club, she doesn’t know how she could ever attend without her mami finding out. But she still can’t stop thinking about performing her poems. Because in the face of a world that may not want to hear her, Xiomara refuses to be silent. “Crackles with energy and snaps with authenticity and voice.” —Justina Ireland, author of Dread Nation “An incredibly potent debut.” —Jason Reynolds, author of the National Book Award Finalist Ghost “Acevedo has amplified the voices of girls en el barrio who are equal parts goddess, saint, warrior, and hero.” —Ibi Zoboi, author of American Street This young adult novel, a selection of the Schomburg Center's Black Liberation Reading List, is an excellent choice for accelerated tween readers in grades 6 to 8.

Nicholls""}""","""The Z notation has been developed at the Programming Research Group at the Oxford University Computing Laboratory and elsewhere for over a decade. It is now used by industry as part of the software (and hardware) development process in both Europe and the USA. It is currently undergoing BSI standardisation in the UK, and has been proposed for ISO standardisation internationally. In recent years researchers have begun to focus increasingly on the development of techniques and tools to encourage the wider application of Z and other formal methods and notations. This volume contains papers from the Seventh Annual Z User Meeting, held in London in December 1992. In contrast to previous years the meeting concentrated specifically on industrial applications of Z, and a high proportion of the participants came from an industrial background. The theme is well represented by the four invited papers. Three of these discuss ways in which formal methods are being introduced, and the fourth presents an international survey of industrial applications. It also provides a reminder of the improvements which are needed to make these methods an accepted part of software development. In addition the volume contains several submitted papers on the industrial use of Z, two of which discuss the key area of safety-critical applications. There are also a number of papers related to the recently-completed ZIP project. The papers cover all the main areas of the project including methods, tools, and the development of a Z Standard, the first publicly-available version of which was made available at the meeting. Finally the volume contains a select Z bibliography, and section on how to access information on Z through comp.specification.z, the international, computer-based USENET newsgroup. Z User Workshop, London 1992 provides an important overview of current research into industrial applications of Z, and will provide invaluable reading for researchers, postgraduate students andalso potential industrial users of Z.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A4rfBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781447135562""","""en"

"aU9BDgAAQBAJ""","""Roger L'Estrange and the Making of Restoration Culture""","{"Beth Lynch"}","""Roger L'Estrange (1616-1704) was one of the most remarkable, significant and colourful figures in seventeenth-century England. Whilst there has been regular, if often cursory, scholarly interest in his activities as Licenser and Stuart apologist, this is the first sustained book-length study of the man for almost a century. L'Estrange's engagement on the Royalist side during the Civil war, and his energetic pamphleteering for the return of the King in the months preceding the Restoration earned him a reputation as one of the most radical royalist apologists. As Licenser for the Press under Charles II, he was charged with preventing the printing and publication of dissenting writings; his additional role as Surveyor of the Press authorised him to search the premises of printers and booksellers on the mere suspicion of such activity. He was also a tireless pamphleteer, journalist, and controversialist in the conformist cause, all of which made him the bête noire of Whigs and non-conformists. This collection of essays by leading scholars of the period highlights the instrumental role L'Estrange played in the shaping of the political, literary, and print cultures of the Restoration period. Taking an interdisciplinary approach the volume covers all the major aspects of his career, as well as situating them in their broader historical and literary context. By examining his career in this way the book offers insights that will prove of worth to political, social, religious and cultural historians, as well as those interested in seventeenth-century literary and book history.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aU9BDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781351902656""","""en"

Both on-shell (at the mass of around 125 GeV) and off-shell (above 200 GeV) Higgs boson production is studied and an excess of off-shell production with significance above two standard deviations is observed for the first time. The latter is a qualitative new way to study the Higgs field, responsible for generation of mass of all the known elementary particles. In addition, phenomenological tools have been developed with the Monte Carlo event generator and matrix element techniques for an optional analysis of LHC data. Optimization of the CMS data with careful alignment of the silicon tracker is also presented.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aUWyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9783030254742""","""en"

Sandberg and her two young children were devastated, and she was certain that their lives would never have real joy or meaning again. Just weeks later, Sandberg was talking with a friend about the first father-child activity without a father. They came up with a plan for someone to fill in. “But I want Dave,” she cried. Her friend put his arm around her and said, “Option A is not available. So let’s just kick the shit out of Option B.” Everyone experiences some form of Option B. We all deal with loss: jobs lost, loves lost, lives lost. The question is not whether these things will happen but how we face them when they do. Thoughtful, honest, revealing and warm, OPTION B weaves Sandberg’s experiences coping with adversity with new findings from Adam Grant and other social scientists. The book features stories of people who recovered from personal and professional hardship, including illness, injury, divorce, job loss, sexual assault and imprisonment. These people did more than recover—many of them became stronger. OPTION B offers compelling insights for dealing with hardships in our own lives and helping others in crisis. It turns out that post-traumatic growth is common—even after the most devastating experiences many people don’t just bounce back but actually bounce forward. And pre-traumatic growth is also possible: people can build resilience even if they have not experienced tragedy. Sandberg and Grant explore how we can raise strong children, create resilient communities and workplaces, and find meaning, love and joy in our lives. “Dave’s death changed me in very profound ways,” Sandberg writes. “I learned about the depths of sadness and the brutality of loss. But I also learned that when life sucks you under, you can kick against the bottom, break the surface and breathe again.”""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aYt3DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780753548301""","""en"

"BnUfPoWk_IEC""","""Identification and Expression of G Protein-Coupled Receptors""","{"Kevin R. Lynch"}","""The past decade has seen tremendous advances in the study of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including the molecular cloning and identification of more than 100 hundred GPCR genes. But while GPCRs serve as targets for more than 300 medicines in the modern pharmacopoeia, the shrinking pool of known ligands and the continuing discovery of orphan GPCR genes have underscored the need for new approaches to ligand identification. Identification and Expression of G Protein-Coupled Receptors addresses this new direction in GPCR biochemistry-offering a definitive laboratory bench manual that emphasizes expression over primary cloning strategies. In a series of expert contributions by well-known researchers, this book provides detailed protocols for various expression systems-from bacteria to mammalian cells-as well as straightforward opinions on the advantages and shortcomings of each approach. Topics covered include: * Homology screening and the polymerase chain reaction in the cloning of GPCR genes * Cloning of GPCRs using mammalian cell expression * GPCR informatics and the orphan problem * The use of Xenopus laevis oocytes for the study of GPCRs * Stable expression of GPCRs in mammalian cells * Heterologous expression in primary cell cultures * Expression of GPCR in Escherichia coli * Large scale expression and purification of GPCRs in mammalian cells * High-level expression of GPCRs in the Baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system * Expression of GPCRs in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells * Methods for genetic analysis and ligand identification using heterologous GPCRs expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Supplemented with numerous photographs and illustrations, Identification and Expression of G Protein-Coupled Receptors is important reading for biochemists, pharmacologists, neuroscientists, structural biologists, and anyone involved in GPCR-based research. It delivers a wealth of useful advice, practical tips, and invaluable insight into trends at the cutting-edge of current research.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BnUfPoWk_IEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""047119493X""","""en"

What happens in an e-learning course that is designed to foster group work and a sense of ‘community’? How can we research e-learning practice in ways that will enhance the processes of learning and teaching? This book outlines approaches to networked e-learning course design that are underpinned by a belief that students learn best in these contexts when they are organised in groups and communities. As such, the book is one of the first to provide a detailed analysis of what goes on in e-learning groups and communities. But how do students react to working in e-learning groups and communities? What determines their willingness to adopt new forms of learning in order to participate in these new courses? What actually happens in an e-learning community, and what impact does this have on students and tutors? This book examines these key questions through a variety of research approaches aimed at exploring the experience of e-learners as they participate in successful e-groups and communities. It also offers ways in which learning outcomes may be achieved in these communities and outlines the specific skills that students would develop through e-learning. E-learning Groups and Communities is essential reading for teachers, trainers, managers, researchers and students involved in e-learning courses as well as people interested in improving the quality of the learning experience.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ckQWwq4Vg-IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780335226399""","""en"

Hawkeye Pierce, Radar O'Reilly, Trapper John McIntyre, Sherman Potter, Margaret (Hot Lips) Houlihan, B.J. Hunnicutt, Frank Burns, Charles Emerson Winchester, Max Klinger--these and the many other characters who populated the MASH 4077 used the Korean War as a backdrop to comment on many of the social issues of their day. Using a unique blend of comedy and drama, the show's first three seasons (1972-1975) focused on the anti-Vietnam War sentiment that consumed much of America. As Vietnam ended, M*A*S*H moved on to concentrate on other contemporary issues--the women's movement, the rise of the religious right in American politics, the new narcissism that marked the early 1980s, the heightened awareness of underage or excessive alcohol use, and the increased emphasis on family in American life. How the series presented these issues and its success in doing so are the subjects of this critical study. An episode listing--brief plot outline, casts and credits, air dates, and titles--is also provided.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CMPx-jksa6IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""0786417013""","""en"

As such, network analysis is an important growth area in the quantitative sciences, with roots in social network analysis going back to the 1930s and graph theory going back centuries. Measurement and analysis are integral components of network research. As a result, statistical methods play a critical role in network analysis. This book is the first of its kind in network research. It can be used as a stand-alone resource in which multiple R packages are used to illustrate how to conduct a wide range of network analyses, from basic manipulation and visualization, to summary and characterization, to modeling of network data. The central package is igraph, which provides extensive capabilities for studying network graphs in R. This text builds on Eric D.

The OED defines over half a million words, and includes almost 2.4 million illustrative quotations, providing an invaluable record of English throughout the centuries. The 20-volume Oxford English Dictionary is the accepted authority on the evolution of the English language over the last millennium. It is an unsurpassed guide to the meaning, history, and pronunciation of over half a million words, both present and past. The OED has a unique historical focus. Accompanying each definition is a chronologically arranged group of quotations that trace the usage of words, and show the contexts in which they can be used. The quotations are drawn from a huge variety of international sources - literary, scholarly, technical, popular - and represent authors as disparate as Geoffrey Chaucer and Erica Jong, William Shakespeare and Raymond Chandler, Charles Darwin and John Le Carré. In all, nearly 2.5 million quotations can be found in the OED . Other features distinguishing the entries in the Dictionary are authoritative definitions of over 500,000 words; detailed information on pronunciation using the International Phonetic Alphabet; listings of variant spellings used throughout each word's history; extensive treatment of etymology; and details of area of usage and of any regional characteristics (including geographical origins).""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dpIwuwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api""","""UOM:49015002911064""","""en"

However, having produced such great philosophers as Anselm, Peter Abelard, John Duns Scotus, William of Ockham, Peter Lombard, and the towering Thomas Aquinas, it hardly seems fair to label the medieval period as such. Examining the influence of ancient Greek philosophy as well as of the Arabian and Hebrew scholars who transmitted it, The A to Z of Medieval Philosophy and Theology presents the philosophy of the Christian West from the 9th to the early 17th century.

In an effort to deal with an organization's scattered information resources, Enterprise Content Management, Records Management and Information Culture Amidst E-Government Development investigates the key differences between Enterprise Content Management (ECM) and Records Management (RM), the impact of e-Government development on information management and the role of information in enhancing accountability and transparency of government institutions. The book hence identifies factors that contribute to a well-functioning information infrastructure and further explores how information culture impacts the management of public information. It highlights the Records Continuum Model (RCM) thinking as a more progressive way of managing digital information in an era of pluralization of government information. It also emphasizes the need for information/records management skills amidst e-Government development. Ideas about records, information, and content management have fundamentally changed and developed because of increasing digitalization. Though not fully harmonized, these new ideas commonly stress and underpin the need for a proactive and holistic information management approach. The proactive approach entails planning for the management of the entire information continuum before the information is created. For private enterprises and government institutions endeavoring to meet new information demands from customers, citizens and the society at large, such an approach is a prerequisite for accomplishing their missions. It could be argued that information is and has always been essential to all human activities and we are witnessing a transformation of the information landscape. - Presents research with broad application based on archives and information science, but relevant for information systems, records management, information culture, and e-government - Examines the differences between Enterprise Content Management and Records Management - Bridges a gap between the proponents of Enterprise Content Management and information professionals, such as records managers and archivists""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f_5PCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780081009000""","""en"

They constitute a self-contained account of vector bundles and K-theory assuming only the rudiments of point-set topology and linear algebra. One of the features of the treatment is that no use is made of ordinary homology or cohomology theory. In fact, rational cohomology is defined in terms of K-theory.The theory is taken as far as the solution of the Hopf invariant problem and a start is mode on the J-homomorphism. In addition to the lecture notes proper, two papers of mine published since 1964 have been reproduced at the end. The first, dealing with operations, is a natural supplement to the material in Chapter III. It provides an alternative approach to operations which is less slick but more fundamental than the Grothendieck method of Chapter III, and it relates operations and filtration. Actually, the lectures deal with compact spaces, not cell-complexes, and so the skeleton-filtration does not figure in the notes. The second paper provides a new approach to K-theory and so fills an obvious gap in the lecture notes.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f1NPDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780429973178""","""en"

Today, unemployment hovers at a near-record high, yet 3.5 million American jobs remain unfilled. Why? Because companies simply cannot find people with the skills they actually need. The good news is that this skills gap represents unprecedented opportunities for every person seeking a successful and exciting career. But these opportunities can’t be found inside the walls of the traditional classroom. Instead, they lie in the myriad of educational options that provide the technical, vocational, and soft skills on demand in today’s workplace, such as: -Professional certifications: Start your career faster in fields like bioscience aviation, culinary arts, and medical technology. -Associates degrees: Increase earning potential through inexpensive 2-year programs in subjects like civil engineering, environmental science, education, and nursing. -Apprenticeships: Earn while you learn under the direct supervision of a skilled expert. Far beyond the artisan trades, today’s apprenticeships can be found at companies like Volkswagen and Siemens. -Occupational learning: Refresh or reboot your skill sets through on-the-job training or online education. In Job U, you’ll learn about these paths to rewarding occupations; where to find them and how to parlay them into the best paying job in any field. And along the way, you’ll meet individuals of all ages who have attained their “dream jobs” through a non-traditional education: from an emergency air paramedic, to a lead mechanic of a racecar team, to an engineer of complex gas turbine generators, to a bestselling cookbook author. Whether you are recent high school or college graduate, or well along in your career journey, Job U will help you find your way to a more secure and prosperous future.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FG8OBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780804140799""","""en"

This volume includes the following chapters: Chapter 1, ""Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux on LNXADMIN"" on page 3, describes how to install and configure Red Hat Enterprise Linux onto the Linux Administration server, which performs the cloning and other tasks. Chapter 2, ""Automated Red Hat Enterprise Linux installations by using Kickstart"" on page 37, describes how to use Red Hat's kickstart tool to create Linux systems. This tool is fundamentally different from cloning in that an automated installation is implemented. You can try kickstart and cloning. Understand that these applications attempt to accomplish the same goal of quickly getting Linux systems up and running, and that you do not need to use both. Chapter 3, ""Working with subscription-manager, yum, and DaNdiFied"" on page 47, describes how the Red Hat Network works. It provides centralized management and provisioning for multiple Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems. Kickstart is an easy and fast way to provision your Linux guests in any supported Linux platform. It re-creates the operating system from the beginning by using the kickstart profile configuration file that installs the new operating system unattended. It also sets up the new guest according to the definition that was set up in the kickstart file. Usually, Linux is administered by the same team that manages Linux on all platforms. By using kickstart, you can create a basic profile that can be used in all supported platforms and customize Linux profiles, as needed. Cloning requires a better understanding of the z/VM environment and z/VM skills. It is a fast process if you enable the IBM FlashCopy® feature in advance. It clones the disks from a golden image to new disks that are used by the new Linux guest. The process can be automated by using the cloning scripts that are supplied with this book. It is recommended that you start with The Virtualization Cookbook for IBM Z Volume 1: IBM z/VM 7.2, SG24-8147 of this series because the IBM® z/VM hypervisor is the foundation (or base ""layer"") for installing Linux on IBM Z.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FqBIEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780738460062""","""en"

Other people consider a microscope to be simply an aid to the eye; to them microscopy is primarily an expan sion of macroscopy. In actuality, microscopy is both objective and sub jective; it is seeing through an instrument by means of the eye, and more importantly, the brain. The function of the brain is to interpret the eye's image in terms of the object's structure. Thought and experience are required to distinguish structure from artifact. It is said that Galileo (1564-1642) had his associates first look through his telescope microscope at very familiar objects to convince them that the image was a true representation of the object. Then he would have them proceed to hitherto unknown worlds too far or too small to be seen with the un aided eye. Since Galileo's time, light microscopes have been improved so much that performance is now very close to theoretical limits. Electron microscopes have been developed in the last four decades to exhibit thousands of times the resolving power of the light microscope. Through the news media everyone is made aware of the marvelous microscopical accomplishments in imagery. However, little or no hint is given as to what parts of the image are derived from the specimen itself and what parts are from the instrumentation, to say nothing of the changes made during preparation of the specimen.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g1jhBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781468424546""","""en"

This black unit's existence was known to very few even within the navy. Its covert operation aimed at disrupting the maritime commerce lines that sustained the Pakistan Army in its eastern province. Over the next few months, this irregular unit, comprising Indian naval officers, divers, and former Pakistani submariners, set to work. They transformed over 400 Bengali youths from East Pakistan into combat swimmers, trained to assault merchant ships. The gunboats of NCO(X)'s naval wing mined shipping channels and harassed shipping entering East Pakistan. The ferocious campaign waged by this tiny unit was without precedent in the annals of naval warfare. They sank and disabled over 100,000 tonnes of shipping in the province , in support of the government of Bangladesh in exile.

"gM6aEAAAQBAJ""","""Selections from Apuleius Metamorphoses V""","{"Stuart R. Thomson"}","""This is the first intermediate-student edition of a selection from Apuleius' Metamorphoses V. Sections 11–24 are included as Latin text with an accompanying commentary and vocabulary. Focusing on a deliberately concise extract from the original, this edition is designed to be manageable for students reading the text for the first time while also perfectly encapsulating the interest of the longer work and inspiring further study of it. A detailed introduction explains points of literary and stylistic interest, encompassing the beginning of the story, from Metamorphoses IV, section 28. Apuleius is considered one of the great Latin stylists. The tale of Cupid and Psyche, a story set within the larger narrative of his novel, the Metamorphoses, follows the romance of the god of love, Cupid, and his mortal lover, Psyche, brought to disaster by the wiles of Psyche's wicked sisters and the anger of Venus, but eventually reconciled. It is both an adventure story, and an allegory for the relationship between the soul and desire. The selection here contains some of the most hauntingly beautiful Latin prose which has come down to us and gives an unparallelled insight into the relationship between philosophy, religion, and art under the high empire.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gM6aEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781501350443""","""en"

It utilizes the effectiveness of Q-set as a powerful tool in the domain of this particular model. In this article, we leverage this model to define fields under uncertainty. We present the Q-complex neutrosophic soft field (Q-CNSF) and examine the unique algebraic properties associated with this model. Additionally, we explore the relationships between Q-CNSF and Q-neutrosophic soft field (Q-NSF). Furthermore, we define the Cartesian product of QCNSFs and delve into the relevant properties. Through this comprehensive exploration, our aim is to enhance the understanding of Q-CNSFs and their properties, ultimately contributing to the field of algebraic analysis and its practical applications in handling uncertainty and vagueness.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gM8LEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""","""en"

I have endeavored to present the book in a lucid manner which will be easier to understand by all the engineering students. About the Book According to many streams in engineering course there are different chapters in Engineering Mathematics of the same year according to the streams. Hence students faced problem about to buy Engineering Mathematics special book that covered all chapters in a single book. That’s reason student needs to buy many books to cover all chapters according to the prescribed syllabus. Hence need to spend more money for a single subject to cover complete syllabus. So here good news for you, your problem solved.

Many books have been written on Engineering Mathematics by different authors and teachers, but majority of the students find it difficult to fully understand the examples in these books. Also, the Teachers have faced many problems due to paucity of time and classroom workload.

"hsedBQAAQBAJ""","""Aboriginal Customary Law: A Source of Common Law Title to Land""","{"Ulla Secher"}","""Described as 'ground-breaking' in Kent McNeil's Foreword, this book develops an alternative approach to conventional Aboriginal title doctrine. It explains that aboriginal customary law can be a source of common law title to land in former British colonies, whether they were acquired by settlement or by conquest or cession from another colonising power. The doctrine of Common Law Aboriginal Customary Title provides a coherent approach to the source, content, proof and protection of Aboriginal land rights which overcomes problems arising from the law as currently understood and leads to more just results. The doctrine's applicability in Australia, Canada and South Africa is specifically demonstrated. While the jurisprudential underpinnings for the doctrine are consistent with fundamental common law principles, the author explains that the Australian High Court's decision in Mabo provides a broader basis for the doctrine: a broader basis which is consistent with a re-evaluation of case-law from former British colonies in Africa, as well as from the United States, New Zealand and Canada. In this context, the book proffers a reconceptualisation of the Crown's title to land in former colonies and a reassessment of conventional doctrines, including the doctrine of tenure and the doctrine of continuity. 'With rare exceptions ... the existing literature does not probe as deeply or question fundamental assumptions as thoroughly as Dr Secher does in her research. She goes to the root of the conceptual problems around the legal nature of Indigenous land rights and their vulnerability to extinguishment in the former colonial empire of the Crown. This book is a formidable contribution that I expect will be influential in shifting legal thinking on Indigenous land rights in progressive new directions.'

One of the most promising trends is constructing an pxact solution for a cprtain class of models. This task seems to be quite feasible in the light of recent resllits. The situation here is to some extent similar to what was going on in the past ypars with the two-dimensional quantum field theory. Our investigation of conformal Ward identities in a D-dimensional space, carried out as far hack as the late H. J7Gs, showed that in the D-dimensional quantum field theory, irrespective of the type of interartion, there exists a special set of states of the field with the following property: if we rpqllire that one of these states should vanish, this determines an exact solution of 3. certain field model. These states are analogous to null-vectors which determine the minimal models in the two-dimensional field theory. On the other hand, the recent resparches supplied us with a number of indications on the existencp of an intinite-parampter algebra analogous to the Virasoro algebra in spaces of higher dimensions D 2: :~. It has also been shown that this algebra admits an operator rentral expansion.

"ih4BEQAAQBAJ""","""The Strong Sylow Theorem for the Prime p in Simple Locally Finite Groups""","{"Dipl.-Math. Felix F. Flemisch"}","""This research paper continues [15]. We begin with giving a profound overview of the structure of arbitrary simple groups and in particular of the simple locally finite groups and reduce their Sylow theory for the prime p to a quite famous conjecture by Prof. Otto H. Kegel (see [37], Theorem 2.4: ""Let the p-subgroup P be a p-uniqueness subgroup in the finite simple group S which belongs to one of the seven rank-unbounded families. Then the rank of S is bounded in terms of P."") about the rank-unbounded ones of the 19 known families of finite simple groups. We introduce a new scheme to describe the 19 families, the family T of types, define the rank of each type, and emphasise the rôle of Kegel covers. This part presents a unified picture of known results whose proofs are by reference. Subsequently we apply new ideas to prove the conjecture for the alternating groups. Thereupon we are remembering Kegel covers and *-sequences. Next we suggest a way 1) and a way 2) how to prove and even how to optimise Kegel's conjecture step-by-step or peu à peu which leads to Conjecture 1, Conjecture 2 and Conjecture 3 thereby unifying Sylow theory in locally finite simple groups with Sylow theory in locally finite and p-soluble groups whose joint study directs Sylow theory in (locally) finite groups. For any unexplained terminology we refer to [15]. We then continue the program begun above to optimise along the way 1) the theorem about the first type ""An"" of infinite families of finite simple groups step-by-step to further types by proving it for the second type ""A = PSLn"". We start with proving Conjecture 2 about the General Linear Groups over (commutative) locally finite fields, stating that their rank is bounded in terms of their p-uniqueness, and then break down this insight to the Special Linear Groups and the Projective Special Linear (PSL) Groups over locally finite fields. We close with suggestions for future research -> regarding the remaining rank-unbounded types (the ""Classical Groups"") and the way 2), -> regarding (locally) finite and p-soluble groups, and -> regarding Cauchy's and Galois' contributions to Sylow theory in finite groups. We much hope to enthuse group theorists with them.

Mathematical Analysis is composed of three parts: ?Part One presents the analysis of functions of one variable, including sequences, continuity, differentiation, Riemann integration, series, and the Lebesgue integral. A detailed explanation of proof writing is provided with specific attention devoted to standard proof techniques. To facilitate an efficient transition to more abstract settings, the results for single variable functions are proved using methods that translate to metric spaces. ?Part Two explores the more abstract counterparts of the concepts outlined earlier in the text. The reader is introduced to the fundamental spaces of analysis, including Lp spaces, and the book successfully details how appropriate definitions of integration, continuity, and differentiation lead to a powerful and widely applicable foundation for further study of applied mathematics. The interrelation between measure theory, topology, and differentiation is then examined in the proof of the Multidimensional Substitution Formula. Further areas of coverage in this section include manifolds, Stokes' Theorem, Hilbert spaces, the convergence of Fourier series, and Riesz' Representation Theorem. ?Part Three provides an overview of the motivations for analysis as well as its applications in various subjects. A special focus on ordinary and partial differential equations presents some theoretical and practical challenges that exist in these areas. Topical coverage includes Navier-Stokes equations and the finite element method. Mathematical Analysis: A Concise Introduction includes an extensive index and over 900 exercises ranging in level of difficulty, from conceptual questions and adaptations of proofs to proofs with and without hints. These opportunities for reinforcement, along with the overall concise and well-organized treatment of analysis, make this book essential for readers in upper-undergraduate or beginning graduate mathematics courses who would like to build a solid foundation in analysis for further work in all analysis-based branches of mathematics.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jaE0dvv309YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""0470226765""","""en"

Today, nearly thirty years after his death, the man is still so revered that the mysteries of his biography are often overlooked. Who was George Balanchine? Born in Russia under the last Czar, Balanchine experienced the upheavals of World War One, the Russian Revolution, exile, World War Two and the cultural Cold War; he was part of the Russian modernist moment, a key player in Paris in the 1920s, and in New York he revolutionized ballet, pressing it to the forefront of modernism and making it serious and popular art. His influences were myriad. He considered himself Georgian, yet he did not step foot in his ancestral homeland until he was in his fifties. He was deeply influenced by the cold grandeur and sensuous beauty of the Orthodox Church, but equally absorbed by the new rhythms and dance steps coming out of Harlem in the 1930s. He collaborated broadly, with figures like Diaghilev and Stravinsky. A man of muses, Balanchine was married five times, always to young dancers, and consumed by many other loves in between. The difficulties of his life - personal losses, bouts of ill health, debilitating loneliness and dark moods of despair - resonate in his dances, which speak so poignantly of love and loss, and yet the full implications for his art remain unexplored. Now for the first time we look beyond the myth of 'Mr B' - the mask which Balanchine himself helped to create - to see 'Mr B' the man.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jCyWEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781847087744""","""en"

I have also used only real and complex numbers in my investigations in functional analysis and its applications to the quantum field theory and I was sure that these number fields can be a basis of every physical model generated by nature. But recently new models of the quantum physics were proposed on the basis of p-adic numbers field Qp. What are p-adic numbers, p-adic analysis, p-adic physics, p-adic probability? p-adic numbers were introduced by K. Hensel (1904) in connection with problems of the pure theory of numbers. The construction of Qp is very similar to the construction of (p is a fixed prime number, p = 2,3,5, ... ,127, ... ). Both these number fields are completions of the field of rational numbers Q.

"K36mDwAAQBAJ""","""United States v. Apple""","{"Chris Sagers"}","""One of the most-followed antitrust cases of recent times—United States v. Apple—reveals an often-missed truth: what Americans most fear is competition itself. In 2012 the Department of Justice accused Apple and five book publishers of conspiring to fix ebook prices. The evidence overwhelmingly showed an unadorned price-fixing conspiracy that cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars. Yet before, during, and after the trial millions of Americans sided with the defendants. Pundits on the left and right condemned the government for its decision to sue, decrying Amazon’s market share, railing against a new high-tech economy, and rallying to defend beloved authors and publishers. For many, Amazon was the one that should have been put on trial. But why? One fact went unrecognized and unreckoned with: in practice, Americans have long been ambivalent about competition. Chris Sagers, a renowned antitrust expert, meticulously pulls apart the misunderstandings and exaggerations that industries as diverse as mom-and-pop grocers and producers of cast-iron sewer pipes have cited to justify colluding to forestall competition. In each of these cases, antitrust law, a time-honored vehicle to promote competition, is put on the defensive. Herein lies the real insight of United States v. Apple. If we desire competition as a policy, we must make peace with its sometimes rough consequences. As bruising as markets in their ordinary operation often seem, letting market forces play out has almost always benefited the consumer. United States v. Apple shows why supporting cases that protect price competition, even when doing so hurts some of us, is crucial if antitrust law is to protect and maintain markets.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K36mDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780674972216""","""en"

"KKDwDwAAQBAJ""","""Quantum Mechanics with Non-Unitary Symmetries""","{"Bojan Bistrovic"}","""This book shows that with minimal modifications of postulates of non-relativistic quantum mechanics to allow for non-unitary representations of symmetry groups (Lorentz group in particular), one achieves a fully relativistic quantum theory without any of the issues (like negative energies, etc.) that led to the second quantization and QFT. It is shown that quite a few phenomena in elementary particle physics (like for example neutral kaon mixing, CP symmetry and it's supposed breaking) can be explained purely as a consequence of relativistic invariance and relativistic invariance alone. It is shown that by categorizing mesons via the representation of Lorentz group they belong to, one can explain a lot of their properties, as well as a lot of discrepancies in the particle data tables. It is also shown that based on properties of Lorentz representations of products of meson decays, a lot of excited states listed in PDG tables are really several different excitations with similar masses. Relativistic treatment of bound states in momentum space is developed and used to calculate decay widths of various composite particles like Positronium or mesons, and then those decay widths are used to calculate various properties of quarks (like their masses or charges) that were previously misunderstood. In particular, it is shown that quarks are actually quite heavy (around 3.5GeV for up/down quarks) and that while Lorentz invariance allows both fractional values (2/3, -1/3) as well as integer values (2,1), based on (very sparse) available experimental data, integer quark charges are more consistent with observed decay widths than fractional charges.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KKDwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781734919912""","""en"

Santaló Summer School on $p$-Adic Analysis, Arithmetic and Singularities, which was held from June 24–28, 2019, at the Universidad Internacional Menéndez Pelayo, Santander, Spain. The main purpose of the book is to present and analyze different incarnations of the local zeta functions and their multiple connections in mathematics and theoretical physics. Local zeta functions are ubiquitous objects in mathematics and theoretical physics. At the mathematical level, local zeta functions contain geometry and arithmetic information about the set of zeros defined by a finite number of polynomials. In terms of applications in theoretical physics, these functions play a central role in the regularization of Feynman amplitudes and Koba-Nielsen-type string amplitudes, among other applications. This volume provides a gentle introduction to a very active area of research that lies at the intersection of number theory, $p$-adic analysis, algebraic geometry, singularity theory, and theoretical physics. Specifically, the book introduces $p$-adic analysis, the theory of Archimedean, $p$-adic, and motivic zeta functions, singularities of plane curves and their Poincaré series, among other similar topics. It also contains original contributions in the aforementioned areas written by renowned specialists. This book is an important reference for students and experts who want to delve quickly into the area of local zeta functions and their many connections in mathematics and theoretical physics.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ktt1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781470467791""","""en"

Since its launch in 2001, Wikipedia has been a lightning rod for debates about knowledge and traditional authority. It has come under particular scrutiny from publishers of print encyclopedias and college professors, who are skeptical about whether a crowd-sourced encyclopedia—in which most entries are subject to potentially endless reviewing and editing by anonymous collaborators whose credentials cannot be established—can ever truly be accurate or authoritative. In Wikipedia U, Thomas Leitch argues that the assumptions these critics make about accuracy and authority are themselves open to debate. After all, academics are expected both to consult the latest research and to return to the earliest sources in their field, each of which has its own authority. And when teachers encourage students to master information so that they can question it independently, their ultimate goal is to create a new generation of thinkers and makers whose authority will ultimately supplant their own. Wikipedia U offers vital new lessons about the nature of authority and the opportunities and challenges of Web 2.0.

In this new biography, tracing the nine long decades of his life, from his growing-up years, his relationships to his writings and talks, Roshen Dalal provides a much-needed corrective – an objective and balanced view of his legacy. Adopted by Theosophists at the age of fourteen, and proclaimed a world teacher and messiah, in 1929, Krishnamurti dissolved the Order of the Star created for him and went on to develop his own philosophy. What is it about his ideas that draws the following of generations of people? Delivered to a divided world then, what makes his message so relevant now? While his ideas on education are idealistic, why do they continue to be everlasting in their contribution and appeal? Krishnamurti’s vision is of a world without boundaries or wars, a world where compassion and goodness predominate, and his message is that such a world can be arrived at only through individual transformation.B24 There is no direct path to transformation, yet through intense perception and understanding, it is possible to achieve this goal.

Drawing on her extensive research in Korea and its diasporas, Haekyung Um describes and analyses the creative processes of p’ansori, weaving into her discussion musical, social and cultural aspects that include the evolution of p’ansori performance, origins and historical development, textual and musical materials, stylistic features of different p’ansori schools, transmission of knowledge, aesthetics, and changing interpretations of tradition. Also explored is the complexity of historical and contemporary influences that give shape to p’ansori as a ‘living tradition’ across the ages and into the present, and as a cultural icon with an enduring narrative and emotional impact. Social, economic and political dynamics are created in the nexus of traditional feudal values, colonial modernity and nationalism. The impact of aspects of late modernity such as technology, mass media, migration and globalization, has transported p’ansori into digital and transnational domains. By bringing all these creative and contextual processes together, Haekyung Um explains how a tradition is created, maintained and redefined by the dynamic interactions of agents, values, meanings, strategies, identities and artistic hybridity.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M168AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781472414564""","""en"

"MfWvDwAAQBAJ""","""F-102 Delta Dagger Units""","{"Peter E. Davies"}","""World War II saw the development of the heavy bomber as a decisive weapon which, in sufficient numbers, could overcome defensive fighters and guns and lay waste to strategic targets. The addition of nuclear weapons to the bomber's armament made it even more formidable, and by the late 1940s, US planners saw the growth of a Soviet nuclear-armed bomber fleet as a terrifying threat to North American security. Conventional subsonic fighters with guns and free-flight air-to-air rockets would be incapable of reaching these incoming bombers in time to prevent even one from delivering a devastating nuclear attack. As a result, supersonic speed, long-range guided missiles and precise radar-based control of an interception became prerequisites for a new breed of fighters, beginning with the F-102. A massive research and development effort produced the F-102A '1954 Fighter', the J57 afterburning turbojet, its Hughes MX-1554 fire control system and, in due course, the Semi-Active Ground Environment (SAGE) radar and communications network that covered North America to guide its airborne defences. In service, F-102As also provided air defence in Europe with USAFE, in the Far East and in Southeast Asia, where they protected US airbases in South Vietnam and Thailand from air attack by North Vietnamese fighters and bombers and escorted B-52s and fighter-bombers on their attack sorties. This illustrated study from leading expert Peter E. Davis details the design, development, and deployment of the futuristic F-102, including its complex research program and role in Vietnam.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MfWvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781472840684""","""en"

And yet, paywalls put in place by multi-billion dollar publishing houses are still preventing millions from accessing quality, scientific knowledge – and public trust in science is under threat. On 4 September 2018, a bold new initiative known as ‘Plan S’ was unveiled, kickstarting a world-wide shift in attitudes towards open access research. For the first time, funding agencies across continents joined forces to impose new rules on the publication of research, with the aim of one day making all research free and available to all. What followed was a debate of global proportions, as stakeholders asked: Who has the right to access publicly-funded research? Will it ever be possible to enforce change on a multi-billion dollar market dominated by five major players? Here, the scheme’s founder, Robert-Jan Smits, makes a compelling case for Open Access, and reveals for the first time how he set about turning his controversial plan into reality – as well as some of the challenges faced along the way.

Since publication of the 10th edition in 1989, there has been rising awareness of the impact of nutrition on chronic disease. In light of new research findings and a growing public focus on nutrition and health, the expert panel responsible for formulation RDAs reviewed and expanded its approachâ€""the result: Dietary Reference Intakes. This new series of references greatly extends the scope and application of previous nutrient guidelines. For each nutrient the book presents what is known about how the nutrient functions in the human body, what the best method is to determine its requirements, which factors (caffeine or exercise, for example) may affect how it works, and how the nutrient may be related to chronic disease. The first volume of Dietary Reference Intakes includes calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, vitamin D, and fluoride. The second book in the series presents information about thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, biotin, and choline. Based on analysis of nutrient metabolism in humans and data on intakes in the U.S. population, the committee recommends intakes for each age groupâ€""from the first days of life through childhood, sexual maturity, midlife, and the later years. Recommendations for pregnancy and lactation also are made, and the book identifies when intake of a nutrient may be too much. Representing a new paradigm for the nutrition community, Dietary Reference Intakes encompasses: Estimated Average Requirements (EARs). These are used to set Recommended Dietary Allowances. Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs). Intakes that meet the RDA are likely to meet the nutrient requirement of nearly all individuals in a life-stage and gender group. Adequate Intakes (AIs). These are used instead of RDAs when an EAR cannot be calculated. Both the RDA and the AI may be used as goals for individual intake. Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs). Intakes below the UL are unlikely to pose risks of adverse health effects in healthy people. This new framework encompasses both essential nutrients and other food components thought to pay a role in health, such as dietary fiber. It incorporates functional endpoints and examines the relationship between dose and response in determining adequacy and the hazards of excess intake for each nutrient.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mt9QdSxOaBMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780309064033""","""en"

Most customers now integrate business analytics with OLTP by running, for example, scoring functions from transactional context for real-time analytics or by applying machine-learning algorithms on enterprise data that is kept on the mainframe. As a result, IBM adds investment so clients can keep the complete lifecycle for data analysis, modeling, and scoring on z Systems control in a cost-efficient way, keeping the qualities of services in availability, security, reliability that z Systems solutions offer. Because of the changed architecture and tighter integration, IBM has shown, in a customer proof-of-concept, that a particular client was able to achieve an orders-of-magnitude improvement in performance, allowing that client's data scientist to investigate the data in a more interactive process. Open technologies, such as Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) can help customers update single components instead of being forced to replace everything at once. As a result, you have the possibility to combine your preferred tool for model generation (such as SAS Enterprise Miner or IBM SPSS® Modeler) with a different technology for model scoring (such as Zementis, a company focused on PMML scoring). IBM SPSS Modeler is a leading data mining workbench that can apply various algorithms in data preparation, cleansing, statistics, visualization, machine learning, and predictive analytics. It has over 20 years of experience and continued development, and is integrated with z Systems. With IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator 5.1 and SPSS Modeler 17.1, the possibility exists to do the complete predictive model creation including data transformation within DB2 Analytics Accelerator. So, instead of moving the data to a distributed environment, algorithms can be pushed to the data, using cost-efficient DB2 Accelerator for the required resource-intensive operations. This IBM Redbooks® publication explains the overall z Systems architecture, how the components can be installed and customized, how the new IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator loader can help efficient data loading for z Systems data and external data, how in-database transformation, in-database modeling, and in-transactional real-time scoring can be used, and what other related technologies are available. This book is intended for technical specialists and architects, and data scientists who want to use the technology on the z Systems platform. Most of the technologies described in this book require IBM DB2 for z/OS®. For acceleration of the data investigation, data transformation, and data modeling process, DB2 Analytics Accelerator is required. Most value can be achieved if most of the data already resides on z Systems platforms, although adding external data (like from social sources) poses no problem at all.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MTPQDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780738441863""","""en"
"mTxWEQAAQBAJ""","""The Afterlife of Malcolm X""","{"Mark Whitaker"}","""Published to coincide with the hundredth anniversary of his birth, the first major study of Malcolm X’s influence in the sixty years since his assassination, exploring his enduring impact on culture, politics, and civil rights. Malcolm X has become as much of an American icon as Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, or Martin Luther King. But when he was murdered in 1965, he was still seen as a dangerous outsider. White America found him alienating, mainstream African Americans found him divisive, and even his admirers found him bravely radical. Although Ossie Davis famously eulogized Malcolm X as “our own Black shining prince,” he never received the mainstream acceptance toward which he seemed to be striving in his final year. It is more in death than his life that Malcolm’s influence has blossomed and come to leave a deep imprint on the cultural landscape of America. With impeccable research and original reporting, Mark Whitaker tells the story of Malcolm X’s far-reaching posthumous legacy. It stretches from founders of the Black Power Movement such as Stokely Carmichael and Huey Newton to hip-hop pioneers such as Public Enemy and Tupac Shakur. Leaders of the Black Arts and Free Jazz movements from Amiri Baraka to Maya Angelou, August Wilson, and John Coltrane credited their political awakening to Malcolm, as did some of the most influential athletes of our time, from Muhammad Ali to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and beyond. Spike’s movie biopic and the Black Lives Matter movement reintroduced Malcolm to subsequent generations. Across the political spectrum, he has been cited as a formative influence by both Barack Obama—who venerated Malcolm’s “unadorned insistence on respect”—and Clarence Thomas, who was drawn to Malcolm’s messages of self-improvement and economic self-help. In compelling new detail, Whitaker also retraces the long road to exoneration for two men wrongfully convicted of Malcolm’s murder, making The Afterlife of Malcolm X essential reading for anyone interested in true crime, American politics, culture, and history.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mTxWEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781668033296""","""en"

Vitamin D affects more than 2000 genes in the body. Serum level of 25(OH) D is an ideal indicator of vitamin D status in our body. Vitamin D deficiency leads to various diseases. On a therapeutic point of view, vitamin D helps to treat many diseases. The book ""A Critical Evaluation of Vitamin D - Clinical Overview"" targets the principles, mechanisms, and clinical significance of vitamin D. This book covers four sections: ""Vitamin D in Cardiovascular and Renal Diseases"", ""Vitamin D in Age and Neurological Diseases"", ""Vitamin D and Cancer"" and ""Therapeutic Measurements of Vitamin D"". Each of these sections is interwoven with the theoretical aspects and experimental techniques of basic and clinical sciences. This book will be a significant source to students, scientists, physicians, healthcare professionals and also other members of this society who are interested in exploring the role of vitamin D in human life.

From telling off a too-perfect sorority sister twenty years later to going public with her ""grumpy vagina""; from facing down those who would judge her in a mall ladies' room to eulogizing her beloved smokin' granny, Reinhardt cuts straight to the heart of the sublime, the ridiculous--and the saggy--realities of being a working wife, mother, and certified slave to a culture that worships women who sport thighs the size of her upper arms.

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

Generally, the bulky Gasper-Rahman notation was used, but the published works on q-calculus looked different depending on where and by whom they were written. This confusion of tongues not only complicated the theoretical development but also contributed to q-calculus remaining a neglected mathematical field. This book overcomes these problems by introducing a new and interesting notation for q-calculus based on logarithms.For instance, q-hypergeometric functions are now visually clear and easy to trace back to their hypergeometric parents. With this new notation it is also easy to see the connection between q-hypergeometric functions and the q-gamma function, something that until now has been overlooked. The book covers many topics on q-calculus, including special functions, combinatorics, and q-difference equations. Apart from a thorough review of the historical development of q-calculus, this book also presents the domains of modern physics for which q-calculus is applicable, such as particle physics and supersymmetry, to name just a few.​""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oBGTUDVyC8cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9783034804318""","""en"

The topics covered include: data acquisition, data quality assessment, filling holes, 3D reconstruction, SLAM, multiple depth camera systems, segmentation, object detection, salience detection, pose estimation, geometric modelling, fall detection, autonomous driving, motor rehabilitation therapy, people counting and cognitive service robots. The availability of cheap RGB-D sensors has led to an explosion over the last five years in the capture and application of colour plus depth data. The addition of depth data to regular RGB images vastly increases the range of applications, and has resulted in a demand for robust and real-time processing of RGB-D data. There remain many technical challenges, and RGB-D image processing is an ongoing research area. This book covers the full state of the art, and consists of a series of chapters by internationally renowned experts in the field. Each chapter is written so as to provide a detailed overview of that topic. RGB-D Image Analysis and Processing will enable both students and professional developers alike to quickly get up to speed with contemporary techniques, and apply RGB-D imaging in their own projects.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OEa5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9783030286033""","""en"
"OervDwAAQBAJ""","""Nissan Z""","{"Pete Evanow"}","""Nissan Z: 50 Years of Exhilarating Performance is the Nissan-official chronicle of Z history, from Datsun's planning for the new model in the late 1960s through the latest 50th anniversary Nissan 370Z. The Datsun 240Z revolutionized the sports car industry and demolished established assumptions about Japanese automakers. With the Z, Datsun gave the world a sleek, sexy, fast product—one that forever banished the idea that Japanese manufacturers could only build economy cars. Over the past 50 years, six generations of the Z car have generated a massive, devoted following. More than 1.5 million cars have been sold worldwide. The retro-inspired 350Z reinvigorated the Z’s fortunes in the 21st century, and the latest incarnation, the 370Z, continues the tradition of high-performance in a modern, affordable package. In addition to a complete history of the Z, this handsomely illustrated book examines the car's significant racing history with successes in IMSA and SCCA sports car racing, including extensive racing by Paul Newman for Bob Sharp and John Morton with Brock Racing Enterprises. Special attention is devoted to the cult of Z-fans around the world who have supported Nissan's sports car through thick and thin and the early car’s emergence as a rapidly appreciating collector car. The story is told by author Pete Evanow, who has enjoyed a long relationship with Nissan. His insights into the history of this automotive icon provide a fresh, compelling perspective on the five decades of the Z that no enthusiast will want to miss.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OervDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780760367148""","""en"

This traditional and affordable front engine/rear-wheel-drive design lends itself to common upgrades and modifications for a wide range of high-performance applications, from drag racing to road racing. Many of the vehicles GM produced using this chassis were powered by V-8 engines, and others had popular turbocharged V-6 configurations. Some of the special-edition vehicles were outfitted with exclusive performance upgrades, which can be easily adapted to other G-Body vehicles. Knowing which vehicles were equipped with which options, and how to best incorporate all the best-possible equipment is thoroughly covered in this book. A solid collection of upgrades including brakes, suspension, and the installation of GMs most popular modern engine-the LS-Series V-8-are all covered in great detail. The aftermarket support for this chassis is huge, and the interchangeability and affordability are a big reason for its popularity. It's the last mass-produced V-8/rear-drive chassis that enthusiasts can afford and readily modify. There is also great information for use when shopping for a G-Body, including what areas to be aware of or check for possible corrosion, what options to look for, and what should be avoided. No other book on the performance aspects of a GM G-Body has been published until now, and this book will serve as the bible to G-Body enthusiasts for years to come.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oIwOJAQdBTsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781613250327""","""en"

His followers call him B, but his enemies say he’s something else: the Antichrist. However, the man Osborne tracks across a landscape of bars, cabarets, and seedy meeting halls is no blasphemous monster—though an earlier era would undoubtedly have rushed him to the burning stake. For B claims to be enunciating a gospel written not on any stone or parchment but in our very genes, opening up a spiritual direction for humanity that would have been unimaginable to any of the prophets or saviors of traditional religion. Pressed by his superiors for a judgement, Osborne is driven to penetrate B’s inner circle, where he soon finds himself an anguished collaborator in the dismantling of his own religious foundations. More than a masterful novel of adventure and suspense, The Story of B is a rich source of compelling ideas from an author who challenges us to rethink our most cherished beliefs.

During the 15 years that have elapsed, a lot has changed. In particular, there is a more widespread use of distributed computing, JavaTM language, new tools, and upgrades in the platform software and hardware. The best practices back then just might not be optimal today. In this IBM® Redbooks® publication, we take a fresh look at bringing packages into the 21st century. We begin with an overview of packages and explain the advantages of using packages. Because database request module (DBRM) based plans have been deprecated in DB2 9, you need to convert to packages if you did not use packages already. We provide guidance on using a DB2 provided function to convert from DBRM-based plans to packages. We re-examine the application development frameworks for packages: program preparation, package setup, and execution. For distributed applications, we include a discussion of a utility to identify and remove deprecated private protocol and converting to DRDA® as well as an introduction to the new pureQuery function of Data Studio. We also discuss common problems and their resolutions. We then explore administration and operational activities dealing with packages, including security, access path management (where we discuss the newly introduced package stability feature to allow for a seamless fallback), and management and performance aspects.

Thus from one point of view, to study a pro-p group is the same as studying an infinite family of finite groups; but a pro-p group is also a compact topological group, and the compactness works its usual magic to bring 'infinite' problems down to manageable proportions. The p-adic integers appeared about a century ago, but the systematic study of pro-p groups in general is a fairly recent development. Although much has been dis covered, many avenues remain to be explored; the purpose of this book is to present a coherent account of the considerable achievements of the last several years, and to point the way forward. Thus our aim is both to stimulate research and to provide the comprehensive background on which that research must be based. The chapters cover a wide range.

"oxZEEQAAQBAJ""","""The Last Turtlemen of the Caribbean""","{"Sharika D. Crawford"}","""Illuminating the entangled histories of the people and commodities that circulated across the Atlantic, Sharika D. Crawford assesses the Caribbean as a waterscape where imperial and national governments vied to control the profitability of the sea. Crawford places the green and hawksbill sea turtles and the Caymanian turtlemen who hunted them at the center of this waterscape. The story of the humble turtle and its hunter, she argues, came to play a significant role in shaping the maritime boundaries of the modern Caribbean. Crawford describes the colonial Caribbean as an Atlantic commons where all could compete to control the region’s diverse peoples, lands, and waters and exploit the region’s raw materials. Focusing on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Crawford traces and connects the expansion and decline of turtle hunting to matters of race, labor, political and economic change, and the natural environment. Like the turtles they chased, the boundary-flouting laborers exposed the limits of states’ sovereignty for a time but ultimately they lost their livelihoods, having played a significant role in legislation delimiting maritime boundaries. Still, former turtlemen have found their deep knowledge valued today in efforts to protect sea turtles and recover the region’s ecological sustainability.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oxZEEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781469660233""","""en"

Topics range from the most recent recommendations for vitamin D intake to new approaches for the treatment and prevention of vitamin D deficiency and the development of active vitamin D drugs to treat psoriasis and cancer. The book demonstrates the significant role that vitamin D has in maintaining good bone health and the prevention of osteoporosis, an important health problem for adults over the age of fifty. In addition, it authoritatively reviews the relationship between sunlight exposure, vitamin D, and increased risk of colon and breast cancer; how vitamin D is made in the skin; and the sequence of events that leads to its activation by the kidney. Also examined are the biological functions of 1,25-dihydrovitamin D3 on the intestine and bone, as well as other tissues, such as skin, the immune system, prostate, and breast, and vitamin D's molecular mechanism of action on the cell membrane and nucleus. The first edition of Vitamin D: Physiology, Molecular Biology and Clinical Applications was the benchmark in the field when published in 1999. This new and expanded volume continues to include extensive, in-depth chapters covering the most important aspects of the complex interactions between vitamin D and other dietary components, the ongoing debate concerning the best indicator of optimal vitamin D status and its nutrient requirements, and the impact of less than optimal status on disease risk. Vitamin D: Physiology, Molecular Biology, and Clinical Applications, Second Edition is designed and organized not only to be an up-to-date review on the subject, but also to provide medical students, graduate students, health care professionals and even the lay public with a reference source for the most up-to-date information about the vitamin D deficiency pandemic and its clinical implications for health and disease.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pyK2iDVWxfwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781603273039""","""en"

"Q9GCAgAAQBAJ""","""Discovering Statistics Using R""","{"Andy Field"","""""Jeremy Miles""""","""""Zoë Field""}""","""Keeping the uniquely humorous and self-deprecating style that has made students across the world fall in love with Andy Field′s books, Discovering Statistics Using R takes students on a journey of statistical discovery using R, a free, flexible and dynamically changing software tool for data analysis that is becoming increasingly popular across the social and behavioural sciences throughout the world. The journey begins by explaining basic statistical and research concepts before a guided tour of the R software environment. Next you discover the importance of exploring and graphing data, before moving onto statistical tests that are the foundations of the rest of the book (for example correlation and regression). You will then stride confidently into intermediate level analyses such as ANOVA, before ending your journey with advanced techniques such as MANOVA and multilevel models. Although there is enough theory to help you gain the necessary conceptual understanding of what you′re doing, the emphasis is on applying what you learn to playful and real-world examples that should make the experience more fun than you might expect. Like its sister textbooks, Discovering Statistics Using R is written in an irreverent style and follows the same ground-breaking structure and pedagogical approach. The core material is augmented by a cast of characters to help the reader on their way, together with hundreds of examples, self-assessment tests to consolidate knowledge, and additional website material for those wanting to learn more. Given this book′s accessibility, fun spirit, and use of bizarre real-world research it should be essential for anyone wanting to learn about statistics using the freely-available R software.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q9GCAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781446289150""","""en"

For example, in fiction, a postmodernist novel might tell a story about a writer struggling with writing (only, perhaps, to find that he is a character in a book by another writer struggling to write a book). The A to Z of Postmodernist Literature and Theater examines the different areas of postmodernist literature and the variety of forms that have been produced. This is accomplished through a chronology, an introductory essay, a bibliography, and several hundred cross-referenced dictionary entries on individual postmodernist writers, the important postmodernist aesthetic practices, significant texts produced throughout the history of postmodernist writing, and important movements and ideas that have created a variety of literary approaches within the form. By placing these concerns within the historical, philosophical, and cultural contexts of postmodernism, this reference explores the frameworks within which postmodernist literature of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century operates.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QING7IczvqEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780810870215""","""en"

Although the Battle of the Atlantic lasted several years, its most critical phase began once the United States entered World War II. By December 1941, the British had mastered the U-boat threat in the Eastern Atlantic, only to see the front abruptly expand to regions the US Navy would patrol, chiefly the Atlantic Seaboard. Unless the US Navy overcame the U-boat threat, the Allies would struggle to win. The Battle of the Atlantic was made up of thousands of individual duels: aircraft against U-boats, aircraft against aircraft, aircraft against ships-but most crucially, ships against U-boats. The individual clashes between Germany's U-boats and the Allied warships escorting the vital convoys often comprised one-on-one actions. These stories provide the focus of this detailed work. The technical details of the U-boats, destroyers, and destroyer escorts involved are explored in stunning illustrations, including ship and submarine profiles and weaponry artworks, and key clashes are brought to life in dramatic battlescenes. Among the clashes covered are including USS Kearny vs. U-568, USS Roper (DD-147) vs U-85, USS Eugene E.

The special demands on psychiatric providers are addressed in Richard Rosner's proposal for the legal regulation of the practice of adolescent psychiatry and Alan Tuckman's and Dominic Ferro's consideration of professional liability and malpractice in adolescent psychiatry. The treatment challenges addressed in Part II are complementary to the focus on the legal aspects of clinical work with adolescents. Contributors address the impact of adolescent hostility on the therapeutic process; the evaluation of teenagers who make threats in school settings; the evaluation and treatment of boys who have been sexually abused by clergy; the psychotherapy of learning-disabled adolescents; and the assessment and treatment of juveniles who commit sex crimes. Volume 28 concludes with two chapters that underscore the ASAP's commitment to timely consideration of the relations among culture, development, and psychopathology.

"rMSAEAAAQBAJ""","""The Allied Air Campaign Against Hitler's U-boats""","{"Timothy S. Good"}","""No weapon platform sank more U-boats in the Second World War than the Allied aircraft. Whether it was an American ’plane operating from American escort carriers, US aircraft from Royal Air Force bases, or British aircraft from bases throughout the world, these officers and men became the most decisive factor in turning the tide of the Battle of the Atlantic against the German submarine threat. While the German crews could threaten escort vessels with torpedoes, or avoid them by remaining submerged, their leaders never developed an effective strategy against aircraft. However, the Allied aircraft did not enjoy much early success. British, Canadian and Australian air crews that fought the U-boats from 1939 until 1941 achieved few triumphs. They possessed neither the aircraft nor the bases necessary to deliver consistent lethal attacks against German submarines. In 1941, the Royal Air Force finally began implementing an effective aircraft response when it initiated training on the American-built Consolidated B-24 Liberators. Supported by other types then in service, these four-engine bombers would prove to be decisive. With America’s entry into the war, the United States Navy and the United States Army Air Forces also began employing Liberators against the U-boats so that by mid-1943, the Admiral Karl Dönitz, commander of U-boat forces, withdrew his submarines from the North Atlantic in recognition of the Allied aircraft’s new dominance. From Dönitz’s retreat to the end of the war, Allied aircraft continued to dominate the U-boat battle as it shifted to other areas including the Bay of Biscay. Dönitz eventually ordered his U-boats to remain on the surface and engage Allied aircraft as opposed to submerging. This approach did lead to the demise of some Allied aircraft, but it also resulted in even more U-boat being sunk. Most critically, Dönitz acknowledged with his new policy that he knew of no tactics or weapons that would defend his submarines from Allied aircraft. In the end, it was a matter of choosing whether his submariners would die submerged or die surfaced. Either way, Allied aircraft prevailed. The Allied Air Campaign Against Hitler’s U-Boats is the most comprehensive study ever undertaken of this most crucial battle which helped turn the Battle of the Atlantic irrevocably in favour of the Allies.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rMSAEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781399096508""","""en"

Having fun requires challenges that wake up the learner’s curiosity but also provide an emotional reward on overcoming them. This book is designed so that it includes smaller and bigger challenges, in what I call playgrounds, in the hope that all readers will enjoy their path to R fluency. Fluency in the use of a language is a skill that is acquired through practice and exploration. Although rarely mentioned separately, fluency in a computer programming language involves both writing and reading. The parallels between natural and computer languages are many, but differences are also important. For students and professionals in the biological sciences, humanities, and many applied fields, recognizing the parallels between R and natural languages should help them feel at home with R. The approach I use is similar to that of a travel guide, encouraging exploration and describing the available alternatives and how to reach them. The intention is to guide the reader through the R landscape of 2020 and beyond.

"Sd8_EAAAQBAJ""","""Supersingular p-adic L-functions, Maass-Shimura Operators and Waldspurger Formulas""","{"Daniel Kriz"}","""A groundbreaking contribution to number theory that unifies classical and modern results This book develops a new theory of p-adic modular forms on modular curves, extending Katz's classical theory to the supersingular locus. The main novelty is to move to infinite level and extend coefficients to period sheaves coming from relative p-adic Hodge theory. This makes it possible to trivialize the Hodge bundle on the infinite-level modular curve by a ""canonical differential"" that restricts to the Katz canonical differential on the ordinary Igusa tower. Daniel Kriz defines generalized p-adic modular forms as sections of relative period sheaves transforming under the Galois group of the modular curve by weight characters. He introduces the fundamental de Rham period, measuring the position of the Hodge filtration in relative de Rham cohomology. This period can be viewed as a counterpart to Scholze's Hodge-Tate period, and the two periods satisfy a Legendre-type relation. Using these periods, Kriz constructs splittings of the Hodge filtration on the infinite-level modular curve, defining p-adic Maass-Shimura operators that act on generalized p-adic modular forms as weight-raising operators. Through analysis of the p-adic properties of these Maass-Shimura operators, he constructs new p-adic L-functions interpolating central critical Rankin-Selberg L-values, giving analogues of the p-adic L-functions of Katz, Bertolini-Darmon-Prasanna, and Liu-Zhang-Zhang for imaginary quadratic fields in which p is inert or ramified. These p-adic L-functions yield new p-adic Waldspurger formulas at special values.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Sd8_EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780691225739""","""en"

"sIYEEAAAQBAJ""","""Philosophical Letters of David K. Lewis""","{"David K. Lewis"}","""David Kellogg Lewis (1941-2001) was one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century. He made significant contributions to almost every area of analytic philosophy including metaphysics, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of science, and set the agenda for various debates in these areas which carry on to this day. In several respects he remains a contemporary figure, yet enough time has now passed for historians of philosophy to begin to study his place in twentieth century thought. His philosophy was constructed and refined not just through his published writing, but also crucially through his life-long correspondence with fellow philosophers, including leading figures such as D.M. Armstrong, Saul Kripke, W.V. Quine, J.J.C. Smart, and Peter van Inwagen. His letters formed the undercurrent of his published work and became the medium through which he proposed many of his well-known theories and discussed a range of philosophical topics in depth. A selection of his vast correspondence over a 40-year period is presented here across two volumes. As metaphysics is arguably where Lewis made his greatest contribution, this forms the focus of Volume 1. Arranged under the broad areas of Causation, Modality, and Ontology, the letters offer an organic story of the origins, development, breadth, and depth of his metaphysics in its historical context, as well as a glimpse into the influence of his many interlocutors.

Their chronology was ordered by a ruler's genealogy, which, in the case of the pua alii (flower of royalty), was illustrious and far reaching and could be traced to one of the four great gods of Polynesia--Käne, Kü, Lono, and Kanaloa. In these legends, Hawaiians of old sought answers to the questions ""Who are we?"" ""Who are our ancestors and where do they come from?"" ""What lessons can be learned from their conduct?"" Nä Pua Alii o Kauai presents the stories of the men and women who ruled the island of Kauai from its first settlement to the final rebellion against Kamehameha I's forces in 1824. Only fragments remain of the nearly two-thousand-year history of the people who inhabited Kauai before the coming of James Cook in 1778. Now scattered in public and private archives and libraries, these pieces of Hawaii's precontact past were recorded in the nineteenth century by such determined individuals as David Malo, Samuel Kamakau, and Abraham Fornander. All known genealogical references to the Kauai alii nui (paramount chiefs) have been gathered here and placed in chronological order and are interspersed with legends of great voyages, bitter wars, courageous heroes, and passionate romances that together form a rich and invaluable resource.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T5kBEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780824841195""","""en"

Specifically, the open-source programming language Python is one of the most versatile and popular programming languages that are used in the world at the time of writing. This situation is especially true in the data science community, where Python provides many libraries and tools that enable essential AI and ML functions, and where it is supported by a large community of developers that actively contribute to its development. Understanding and managing vulnerabilities within OSS can be complex because of the many components, dependencies, and contributors that are involved. Although the nature of OSS helps balance access to programming and technology, it also results in fast-paced changes to software, which emphasizes the importance of software currency to minimize security concerns. Enterprises understand the critical need to have access to and leverage reputable open-source projects with proper maintenance, updates, transparency, reliable support, and a sense of control to form a secure foundation for implementing AI solutions. Python AI Toolkit for IBM® z/OS® is a powerful set of tools and libraries that is used to establish a secure foundation for AI development and deployment on z/OS so that enterprises can leverage their existing infrastructure for these mission-critical applications. The OSS that is provided within Python AI Toolkit for IBM z/OS is scanned and vetted for security vulnerabilities so that users can make informed decisions when leveraging these Python packages. Packages can be installed and managed by using the Package Installer for Python (pip), which is a common Python package manager, enabling a familiar, flexible, and agile delivery experience while empowering developers to build AI solutions.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Thu-EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780738461137""","""en"

Utilizing a ""learn by example"" approach, this book provides an accessible, yet in-depth, treatment of U-statistics, as well as addresses key concepts in asymptotic theory by integrating translational and cross-disciplinary research. The authors begin with an introduction of the essential and theoretical foundations of U-statistics such as the notion of convergence in probability and distribution, basic convergence results, stochastic Os, inference theory, generalized estimating equations, as well as the definition and asymptotic properties of U-statistics. With an emphasis on nonparametric applications when and where applicable, the authors then build upon this established foundation in order to equip readers with the knowledge needed to understand the modern-day extensions of U-statistics that are explored in subsequent chapters. Additional topical coverage includes: Longitudinal data modeling with missing data Parametric and distribution-free mixed-effect and structural equation models A new multi-response based regression framework for non-parametric statistics such as the product moment correlation, Kendall's tau, and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank tests A new class of U-statistic-based estimating equations (UBEE) for dependent responses Motivating examples, in-depth illustrations of statistical and model-building concepts, and an extensive discussion of longitudinal study designs strengthen the real-world utility and comprehension of this book. An accompanying Web site features SAS? and S-Plus? program codes, software applications, and additional study data.

O'Connell Street will also feature more personal, anecdotal stories of the cinemas, meeting under Clery's clock, buying engagement rings at The Happy Ring House, witnessing motorcades such as the Apollo XIII coming down the street, the heyday of film stars staying at the Gresham, and scandals and murders on the street.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u9MvEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781788493062""","""en"

White and His World""","{"Anne McCauley"}","""Restoring a gifted art photographer to his place in the American canon and, in the process, reshaping and expanding our understanding of early 20th-century American photography Clarence H. White (1871–1925) was one of the most influential art photographers and teachers of the early 20th century and a founding member of the Photo-Secession. This beautiful publication offers a new appraisal of White’s contributions, including his groundbreaking aesthetic experiments, his commitment to the ideals of American socialism, and his embrace of the expanding fields of photographic book and fashion illustration, celebrity portraiture, and advertising. Based on extensive archival research, the book challenges the idea of an abrupt rupture between prewar, soft-focus idealizing photography and postwar “modernism” to paint a more nuanced picture of American culture in the Progressive era. Clarence H. White and His World begins with the artist’s early work in Ohio, which shares with the nascent Arts and Crafts movement the advocacy of hand production, closeness to nature, and the simple life. White’s involvement with the Photo-Secession and his move to New York in 1906 mark a shift in his production, as it grew to encompass commercial portraiture and an increasing commitment to teaching, which ultimately led him to establish the first institutions in America to combine instruction in both technical and aesthetic aspects of photography. The book also incorporates new formal and scientific analysis of White’s work and techniques, a complete exhibition record, and many unpublished illustrations of the moody outdoor scenes and quiet images of domestic life for which he was revered.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UYw-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780300229080""","""en"

When it was introduced into service in 1953, the T-10 represented a return to the “classic” Soviet heavy tank. Although considered a major threat to NATO tank forces, it also represented the end of an era. All gun heavy tanks like the T-10 would eventually be made effectively redundant by later models like the T-62 which had powerful next generation armament and new ammunition types. The tank was gradually withdrawn from service in the 1970s, though the last tanks would only leave Russian service, by decree of the President of the Russian Federation, in 1997. As such the T-10 outlived the Soviet state that had created it. Never exported outside of the Soviet Union and rarely used in combat, the T-10 has remained a mysterious tank, with many of its variants unknown in the West until very recently. This study, written from original Russian and Ukrainian primary source documents that have only recently been made available, uncovers the history of this enigmatic tank using 130 stunning contemporary and modern photographs of the T-10 as well as full colour side-view artwork.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UzAqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781472820525""","""en"

Guilt that she couldn’t prevent Gerald’s devolution from genius scientist, to absent-minded professor, to ‘bat-shit crazy’ at the hands of paranoid schizophrenia.

These changes are delivering manufacturing firms the competitive advantage of a highly flexible and responsive supply chain and manufacturing system to ensure that they meet the high expectations of their customers, who, in today's economy, demand absolutely the best service, price, delivery time and product quality.To make e-manufacturing and supply chain technologies effective, integration is needed between various, often disparate systems. To understand why this is such an issue, one needs to understand what the different systems or system components do, their objectives, their specific focus areas and how they interact with other systems. It is also required to understand how these systems evolved to their current state, as the concepts used during the early development of systems and technology tend to remain in place throughout the life-cycle of the systems/technology. This book explores various standards, concepts and techniques used over the years to model systems and hierarchies in order to understand where they fit into the organization and supply chain. It looks at the specific system components and the ways in which they can be designed and graphically depicted for easy understanding by both information technology (IT) and non-IT personnel.Without a good implementation philosophy, very few systems add any real benefit to an organization, and for this reason the ways in which systems are implemented and installation projects managed are also explored and recommendations are made as to possible methods that have proven successful in the past. The human factor and how that impacts on system success are also addressed, as is the motivation for system investment and subsequent benefit measurement processes.Finally, the vendor/user supply/demand within the e-manufacturing domain is explored and a method is put forward that enables the reduction of vendor bias during the vendor selection process.The objective of this book is to provide the reader with a good understanding regarding the four critical factors (business/physical processes, systems supporting the processes, company personnel and company/personal performance measures) that influence the success of any e-manufacturing implementation, and the synchronization required between these factors.· Discover how to implement the flexible and responsive supply chain and manufacturing execution systems required for competitive and customer-focused manufacturing· Build a working knowledge of the latest plant automation, manufacturing execution systems (MES) and supply chain management (SCM) design techniques· Gain a fuller understanding of the four critical factors (business and physical processes, systems supporting the processes, company personnel, performance measurement) that influence the success of any e-manufacturing implementation, and how to evaluate and optimize all four factors""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VclJ5VyC5QUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9780080473857""","""en"

But soon she finds herself adrift in Wedding Land, a world where all brides are expected to want to look like Cinderella, where women plan weddings with fantasy butterfly themes, where a woman's wedding is, without question, the Happiest Day of Her Life. Despite her best efforts not to become a Bridezilla, Hana finds herself transformed from a thirty-year-old woman with a 401(k) into a nearly unrecognizable version of herself as she spends weeks crafting save-the-date cards, worries about matching her cocktails to her wedding colors, and obsessively reads Martha Stewart Weddings magazine. She decides that, if she is going to follow traditions like wearing white and walking down the aisle with flowers, she at least wants to understand why. In her search she turns up interesting wedding facts: bridesmaids, for instance, were originally recruited to confuse evil spirits. Ultimately, she casts a critical eye on the $72 billion wedding industry, from the women at wedding websites who cackle over the etiquette missteps of others to wedding magazines that provide checklists of 187 tasks to plan the perfect wedding, suggesting that to have anything less is to fail as a bride, as a woman, as a wife. Part confessional memoir, part social critique, A More Perfect Union chronicles a year in Wedding Land, capturing as it does not only the stresses but the undoubted joys of becoming a bride.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vlwix-2zvvEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9781416522935""","""en"

Its primary objective is to bring together in one place information that is already available, but widely dispersed. It also presents a different perspective on planned outage avoidance. Most businesses care about application availability rather than the availability of a specific system. Also, a planned outage is not necessarily a bad thing, if it does not affect application availability. In fact, running for too long without an IPL or subsystem restart might have a negative impact on application availability because it impacts your ability to apply preventive service.

As an extension of a neutrosophic set, the Q-neutrosophic set was introduced to handle two-dimensional uncertain and inconsistent situations. We extend the soft expert set to generalized Q-neutrosophic soft expert set by incorporating the idea of soft expert set to the concept of Q-neutrosophic set and attaching the parameter of fuzzy set while defining a Q-neutrosophic soft expert set. This pattern carries the benefits of Q-neutrosophic sets and soft sets, enabling decision makers to recognize the views of specialists with no requirement for extra lumbering tasks, thus making it exceedingly reasonable for use in decision-making issues that include imprecise, indeterminate and inconsistent two-dimensional data. Some essential operations namely subset, equal, complement, union, intersection, AND and OR operations and additionally several properties relating to the notion of generalized Q-neutrosophic soft expert set are characterized. Finally, an algorithm on generalized Q-neutrosophic soft expert set is proposed and applied to a real-life example to show the efficiency of this notion in handling such problems.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vx7UDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""","""en"

Carl Molesworth describes and explains the design and development of these two foes, the products of two vastly different philosophies of fighter design. The P-40 was heavily armed and sturdy with armour protection and self-sealing fuel tanks, but paid for this with the loss of speed and a sluggish performance at altitude. The Ki-43 was a rapier to the battleaxe P-40 and the Ki-43 was immensely nimble, though with less firepower and durability.

The X-ray emission from this system (Schnopper et al 1976) is thought to be associated with a corona surrounding the lobe filling and synchron ously rotating K IV star. This is based on the similarity of the X-ray spectrum and luminosity of this system to that of the RS CVn binaries which also contain K sub-giants with similar rotation periods and the fact that the luminosity of any coronae surrounding the B8 V and AV companion stars should not be enhanced by rapid rotation (Pallavicini et al 1980, White et al 1980). The Einstein SSS measurement showed the X-ray spectrum to be two component with 6 7 temperatures of 7. 10 K and 3. 10 K (White et al. 1980). As dis cussed by Swank et al. (1981), the problem in understanding stellar coronae in general is how to scale up the solar model to account for the enhanced luminosities. The close to 900 inclination and similar sizes for the Band K stars of 3. 6 and 3. 8 R0 respectively make Algol an ideal candidate for an X-ray eclipse measurement wherein the size of the X-ray emitting coronal structures can be directly measured.

"WqtVDgAAQBAJ""","""What the F""","{"Benjamin K. Bergen"}","""It may be starred, beeped, and censored -- yet profanity is so appealing that we can't stop using it. In the funniest, clearest study to date, Benjamin Bergen explains why, and what that tells us about our language and brains. Nearly everyone swears-whether it's over a few too many drinks, in reaction to a stubbed toe, or in flagrante delicto. And yet, we sit idly by as words are banned from television and censored in books. We insist that people excise profanity from their vocabularies and we punish children for yelling the very same dirty words that we'll mutter in relief seconds after they fall asleep. Swearing, it seems, is an intimate part of us that we have decided to selectively deny. That's a damn shame. Swearing is useful. It can be funny, cathartic, or emotionally arousing. As linguist and cognitive scientist Benjamin K. Bergen shows us, it also opens a new window onto how our brains process language and why languages vary around the world and over time. In this groundbreaking yet ebullient romp through the linguistic muck, Bergen answers intriguing questions: How can patients left otherwise speechless after a stroke still shout Goddamn! when they get upset? When did a cock grow to be more than merely a rooster? Why is crap vulgar when poo is just childish? Do slurs make you treat people differently? Why is the first word that Samoan children say not mommy but eat shit? And why do we extend a middle finger to flip someone the bird? Smart as hell and funny as fuck, What the F is mandatory reading for anyone who wants to know how and why we swear.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WqtVDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api""","""9780465096480""","""en"

Several pilots qualified as astronauts by flying above 50 miles altitude in the X-15, including Neil Armstrong, the first man on the Moon. The three X-15s made 199 flights, testing new technologies and techniques which greatly eased America's entry into manned space travel, and made the Apollo missions and Space Shuttle viable propositions.

No more screwing up. No more screwing, period. As the new team captain, I need a new philosophy: hockey and school now, women later. Which means that I, Hunter Davenport, am officially going celibate . . . no matter how hard that makes things. But there's nothing in the rulebook that says I can't be friends with a woman. And I won't lie - my new classmate Demi Davis is one cool chick. Her smart mouth is hot as hell, and so is the rest of her, but the fact that she's got a boyfriend eliminates the temptation to touch her. Except three months into our friendship, Demi is single and looking for a rebound. And she's making a play for me. Avoiding her is impossible. We're paired up on a yearlong school project, but I'm confident I can resist her. We'd never work, anyway. Our backgrounds are too different, our goals aren't aligned, and her parents hate my guts.

Vampires and hybrids have overrun my world, once vibrant with life, but now a graveyard of death shrouded in shadows. I fight to survive; I fight for my mother and brother. The journey is full of turns that I am quite unprepared for. And I'm just hoping to make it to the next Vegas sunrise..."" In a post-apocalyptic world, a viral epidemic has wiped out most of the earth’s population, leaving behind few humans but untold numbers of mutated vampires. April is a seventeen-year-old girl who lives in the remains of Las Vegas one year after the outbreak. She has become a ferocious vampire killer and after her family is abducted, she goes searching for them. What she finds is a new breed of vampire, unlike any she has seen before. Unsure of whom she can trust, she discovers that her view of the world is not as black and white as she once thought, and she's willing to bend the rules to rescue her family. But in trying to save them, she may only succeed in bringing her fragile world crashing down around her. Disarming Book #2: The world has changed. One must adapt to survive or hold on to the crumbling shards of humanity. April continues to hold her fragile world together, but the ties that hold her family together are quickly unraveling. Rumors of a massive human underground settlement draw her to the shadows of the city once more in search of other survivors more like her, even with the hybrid vampires opposing her every move. The darkness hides secrets along with the continued threat the Feral Vampires create, but a greater evil hides within the city. Something tells April that the humans will be less than welcoming of her, and that's if she can find them before the Vampires do. Joining sides with the enemy might be the only choice she has left. Amplified Book #3: Who wants to be the prey in a world full of hunters? In the aftermath of the end of her world, April Tate decides that it's high time to leave the city that never sleeps, Las Vegas. After learning the origins of a Zompire Plague remedy, she risks her life to steal the antidote, makes the decision to separate from Jeremy for a while, and joins a small band of new and old comrades on a trip to the Pacific Coast. There they search out a legendary hive of vampires who are more than just wild, blood drinking creatures, they could be the very people she needs to help her. On a mission to save the last of humanity, April will use the antidote to save some from eternal damnation, but will her decision bring hope for the future or create an ever bigger, unforeseen devastation? Resonant (Prequel) Surviving is worse than death… As the first days of the end of humanity tumble across the city of Las Vegas in the form of an overwhelming viral infection, turning almost everyone into vampire-like creatures, April Tate will find out what it really means to survive. What does it take to make it out alive in a place where everything is but a withered echo of its former self, and death does not come willingly? Elijah: The Miel Chronicles (A Vampires of Vegas Companion Story) These are the journeys of Miel, the Keeper of the journal. The workings of heaven are shrouded in mystery and myth, leaving us to only theorize as to what awaits us when we pass. There are those among us however, that are special cases.

The text describes statistical models from a conceptual point of view with a minimal amount of mathematics, presuming only an introductory knowledge of statistics. Hands-on chapters accelerate the learning curve by asking readers to interact with R from the beginning. Core topics include the R language, basic statistics, linear modeling, and data visualization, which is presented throughout as an integral part of analysis. Later chapters cover more advanced topics yet are intended to be approachable for all analysts. These sections examine logistic regression, customer segmentation, hierarchical linear modeling, market basket analysis, structural equation modeling, and conjoint analysis in R. The text uniquely presents Bayesian models with a minimally complex approach, demonstrating and explaining Bayesian methods alongside traditional analyses for analysis of variance, linear models, and metric and choice-based conjoint analysis. With its emphasis on data visualization, model assessment, and development of statistical intuition, this book provides guidance for any analyst looking to develop or improve skills in R for marketing applications.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XxnZrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api""","""3319144359""","""en"

Part II deals with the boundary behaviour of minimal surfaces. Part I is particularly apt for students who want to enter this interesting area of analysis and differential geometry which during the last 25 years of mathematical research has been very active and productive. Surveys of various subareas will lead the student to the current frontiers of knowledge and can also be useful to the researcher. The lecturer can easily base courses of one or two semesters on differential geometry on Vol. 1, as many topics are worked out in great detail. Numerous computer-generated illustrations of old and new minimal surfaces are included to support intuition and imagination. Part 2 leads the reader up to the regularity theory for nonlinear elliptic boundary value problems illustrated by a particular and fascinating topic. There is no comparably comprehensive treatment of the problem of boundary regularity of minimal surfaces available in book form.

Por otra parte, la investigación establece el tráfico naviero, los montos de las cargas de cacao que arribaron a Acapulco y las manifestaciones de los precios en el mercado de la ciudad de México y trata de demostrar que la oferta creciente de cacao guayaquil, ayudó a mantener los precios estables en un contexto general de crecimiento de los precios en la segunda parte del siglo XVIII.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y25YBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9786074625943""","""en"

The narrative unfolds with an intricate combination of adventure fiction and science fiction, reflecting the era'Äôs fascination with technological innovation and exploration. Senarens employs vibrant descriptions and fast-paced storytelling, inviting readers to experience the wonder and danger of the deep sea alongside the protagonist, Frank Reade, Jr., as he embarks on a quest for lost treasures that challenges both human courage and ingenuity. Luis Senarens, a prominent author of juvenile literature in the late 19th century, often infused his tales with elements of science and technology, reflecting the progressive ethos of his time. His background as a writer for the popular Frank Reade series showcases his deep understanding of youthful curiosity and adventure.

Four of the authors co-wrote An Introduction to Statistical Learning, With Applications in R (ISLR), which has become a mainstay of undergraduate and graduate classrooms worldwide, as well as an important reference book for data scientists. One of the keys to its success was that each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in the R scientific computing environment. However, in recent years Python has become a popular language for data science, and there has been increasing demand for a Python-based alternative to ISLR.

Goodman"}","""This volume contains the proceedings of the ""Conference on the (p,n) Reaction and the Nucleon-Nucleon Force"" held in Telluride, Colorado, March 29-31, 1979. The idea to hold this conference grew out of a program at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility to study the (p,n) reaction in the 50-200 MeV energy range. The first new Indiana data, in contrast to low energy data, showed features suggestive of a dominant one pion exchange interaction. It seemed desir able to review what was known about the fre·e and the effective nucleon-nucleon force and the connection between the low and high energy (p,n) data. Thus the conference was born. The following people served as the organizing committee: S. M. Austin, Michigan State University W. Bertozzi, Massachusetts Institute of Technology S. D. Bloom, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory C. C. Foster, Indiana University C. D. Goodman, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Conference Chairman) D. A. Lind, University of Colorado J. Rapaport, Ohio University G. R.

"zEAz4EwS4UAC""","""Studying Atomic Dynamics with Coherent X-rays""","{"Michael Leitner"}","""Diffusion in solids at moderate temperatures is a well-known phenomenon. However, direct experimental evidence about the responsible atomic-scale mechanisms has been scarce, due to difficulties in probing the relevant length- and time-scales. The present thesis deals with the application of X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) for answering such questions. This is an established method for the study of slow dynamics on length-scales of a few nanometres. The scattered intensity in the diffuse regime, i.e. corresponding to atomic distances, is very low, however, and so it has so far been considered impossible to use XPCS for this problem. Threefold progress is reported in this work: It proposes a number of systems selected for high diffuse intensity, it optimizes the photon detection and data evaluation procedures, and it establishes theoretical models for interpretating the results. Together these advances allowed the first successful atomic-scale XPCS experiment, which elucidated the role of preferred configurations for atomic jumps in a copper-gold alloy. The growth in available coherent X-ray intensity together with next-generation X-ray sources will open up a wide field of application for this new method.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zEAz4EwS4UAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9783642241215""","""en"

"zV3PEAAAQBAJ""","""Algebraic K-theory: The Homotopy Approach Of Quillen And An Approach From Commutative Algebra""","{"Satya Mandal"}","""In this book the author takes a pedagogic approach to Algebraic K-theory. He tried to find the shortest route possible, with complete details, to arrive at the homotopy approach of Quillen [Q] to Algebraic K-theory, with a simple goal to produce a self-contained and comprehensive pedagogic document in Algebraic K-theory, that is accessible to upper level graduate students. That is precisely what this book faithfully executes and achieves.The contents of this book can be divided into three parts — (1) The main body (Chapters 2-8), (2) Epilogue Chapters (Chapters 9, 10, 11) and (3) the Background and preliminaries (Chapters A, B, C, 1). The main body deals with Quillen's definition of K-theory and the K-theory of schemes. Chapters 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 provide expositions of the paper of Quillen [Q], and chapter 4 is on agreement of Classical K-theory and Quillen K-theory. Chapter 8 is an exposition of the work of Swan [Sw1] on K-theory of quadrics.The Epilogue chapters can be viewed as a natural progression of Quillen's work and methods. These represent significant benchmarks and include Waldhausen K-theory, Negative K-theory, Hermitian K-theory, 𝕂-theory spectra, Grothendieck-Witt theory spectra, Triangulated categories, Nori-Homotopy and its relationships with Chow-Witt obstructions for projective modules. In most cases, the proofs are improvisation of methods of Quillen [Q].The background, preliminaries and tools needed in chapters 2-11, are developed in chapters A on Category Theory and Exact Categories, B on Homotopy, C on CW Complexes, and 1 on Simplicial Sets.""","""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zV3PEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""","""9789811269400""","""en"
